\noindent{\bf Homework 4}

There are two homework problems. The expectation is that students
will submit very high quality proofs. The problem solutions must be written
in LaTeX and compiled to a pdf file. 
Follow the instructions on LMS for how to submit the problem.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Use the Principle of Mathematical Induction to prove that $13^n - 7^n$ is a multiple of 6 for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. \\ Hint: show that $13^n - 7^n = 6 m $ for some integer $m$. 

\item Suppose $a_n$ are real numbers for each $n \in \mathbb{N}.$  Use the \sout{axioms of real numbers} triangle inequality and the Principle of Mathematical Induction to prove that $$\left|\sum_{k=1}^na_k\right| \leq \sum_{k=1}^n|a_k|.$$\\
