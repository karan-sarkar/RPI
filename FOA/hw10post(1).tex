\noindent{\bf Homework 10}

\medskip

There are two homework problems. The expectation is that students
will submit very high quality proofs. The solutions must be written
in LaTeX and compiled to a pdf file. 
Follow the instructions on LMS for how to submit the problems.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space where $S$ is non-empty and $S \subseteq X.$  
Prove that $\bd(S)$ is a closed set of $X$ using the lecture definition of closed.


\item Let $(X,d)$ be a non-empty metric space.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Translate the definition of a limit point of $S \subseteq X$ in terms of the general metric space $(X,d)$.
\item Prove that a non-empty finite subset $S$ has not limit points.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
