\noindent{\bf Homework 7}

There are two homework problems. The expectation is that students
will submit very high quality proofs. The problem solutions must be written
in LaTeX and compiled to a pdf file. 
Follow the instructions on LMS for how to submit the problems.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose that $\left( s_n \right)$ is a convergent sequence where $\lim s_n = 0$.  Prove that the set $S = \left\{ s_n: n \in \mathbb{N} \right\}$ is a bounded set.
\vskip .1in
\item Use the definition of a convergent sequence to prove that $\D \left( \frac{4n+11}{5n^3-2}\right)$ converges to 0. {\em See example 4.1,6}\\ 
\end{enumerate}
