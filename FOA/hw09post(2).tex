\noindent{\bf Homework 9}

\medskip

There are three homework problems. The expectation is that students
will submit very high quality proofs. The solutions must be written
in LaTeX and compiled to a pdf file. 
Follow the instructions on LMS for how to submit the problems.

\begin{enumerate}


\item Let $X = \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$. 
Let ${\bf x}=(x_1,y_1) $ and ${\bf y} = (x_2,y_2)$ be elements of $X.$

The Euclidean metric  $d:X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$ is defined by $d({\bf x},{\bf y}) = \sqrt{\left(x_1-x_2\right)^2+ \left(y_1-y_2\right)^2}.$ Using the fact that $d({\bf x},{\bf y})$ is a metric, define
$d_3({\bf x},{\bf y}) = \min\{1,d({\bf x},{\bf y})\}$  and
\begin{enumerate}
\item Prove that $d_3$ is a metric.
\item For the metric $d_3$, describe $N((0,0);\frac{1}{2})$ $N((0,0);1)$ and $N((0,0);2)$ as a geometric shapes. {\em Description must be typed out in sentence(s). Additionally, you may choose to include a  hand-drawn sketch of the neighborhoods.}
\end{enumerate}

\item Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space where $\Big| X \Big| =n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $n \ge 10$. (Note this means that $X$ has a finite number of points. )\\
Let $S = \{ x ,y \}$ where $x \in X$ and $y \in X$ .
 Using the lecture definitions of open and closed sets, prove that $S$ is both an open set and a closed set in $X$.



\item Let $\displaystyle {N}^*(x;\epsilon) = \{ y \in X: 0 < d(x,y) <  \epsilon \}$ denote a {\bf deleted neighborhood} in $X$.  Using the lecture definitions %\\[.05in] 
of open and closed sets, prove that $\displaystyle {N}^*(x;\epsilon)$ is an open set in $X$.


\end{enumerate}
