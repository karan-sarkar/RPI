We O
never O
expected O
to O
be O
in O
Dalby B-GPE
! O

We O
applied O
for O
our O
Visas O
way O
back O
in O
November O
2005 O
. O

Life O
got O
in O
the O
way O
and O
we O
had O
all O
but O
given O
up O
moving O
to O
Australia B-GPE
. O

But O
as O
the O
final O
leaving O
date O
rapidly O
approached O
we O
decided O
to O
throw O
caution O
to O
the O
wind O
! O

Jobs O
were O
resigned O
our O
belongings O
packed O
( O
very O
stressful O
- O
and O
shippers O
were O
crap O
) O
and O
tickets O
bought O
. O

We O
arrived O
in O
Sydney B-GPE
on O
November O
17th O
stay O
with O
a O
relative B-PER
for O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
. O

We O
travelled O
upto O
the O
Gold B-GPE
Coast I-GPE
as O
we O
had O
planned O
to O
live O
somewhere O
south O
of O
Brisbane B-GPE
. O

Our O
shipping O
container O
arrived O
weeks O
before O
the O
floods O
but O
we O
could O
not O
get O
to O
access O
our O
belongings O
due O
to O
customs O
. O

We O
had O
rented O
a O
house B-FAC
but O
we O
had O
no O
furniture O
so O
had O
to O
buy O
camp O
beds O
to O
sleep O
on O
, O
and O
garden O
chairs O
and O
table O
- O
we O
had O
an O
interesting O
Xmas O
. O

The O
Brisbane B-GPE
floods O
arrived O
and O
thankfully O
after O
a O
few O
days O
of O
anxious O
waiting O
we O
were O
told O
our O
container O
had O
survived O
the O
inundations O
. O

A O
month O
late O
our O
belongings O
finally O
arrived O
. O

BUT O
our O
boat O
which O
was O
also O
being O
shipped O
was O
due O
to O
arrive O
the O
same O
day O
as O
the O
floods O
hit O
. O

We O
got O
an O
e O
mail O
saying O
it O
had O
been O
left O
portside O
in O
Sydney B-GPE
as O
Brisbane B-FAC
port I-FAC
was O
closed O
! O
! O

Panic O
. O
. O
. O
. O
thankfully O
the O
Australian B-GPE
importers O
we O
had O
hired O
were O
fantastic O
and O
it O
was O
re O
shipped O
to O
Brisbane B-GPE
later O
at O
no O
extra O
cost O
. O

As O
teachers O
we O
had O
expected O
to O
be O
able O
to O
get O
jobs O
no O
problem O
. O
. O
. O
. O

wrong O
! O
! O

We O
now O
know O
that O
teaching O
jobs O
in O
south O
Brisbane B-GPE
simply O
don O
' O
t O
exist O
as O
people O
simply O
do O
not O
move O
on O
. O
. O
. O
. O

We O
had O
been O
in O
Australia B-GPE
for O
four O
months O
and O
needed O
to O
do O
something O
radical O
to O
get O
work O
. O

We O
contacted O
QLD B-GPE
education B-ORG
and O
simply O
said O
where O
do O
you O
want O
us O
? O

James B-PER
was O
offered O
a O
job O
in O
Dalby B-GPE
( O
2hrs O
inland O
from O
Brisbane B-GPE
) O
on O
Thurs O
and O
started O
the O
following O
Monday O
. O

He O
was O
given O
an O
education B-ORG
QLD I-ORG
house B-FAC
and O
moved O
in O
with O
absolute O
basics O
. O

After O
a O
few O
weeks O
of O
commuting O
to O
the O
coast B-LOC
to O
be O
with O
us O
( O
me O
and O
2 O
teenage O
kids O
) O
we O
decided O
to O
break O
our O
rental O
lease O
move O
the O
kids O
out O
of O
the O
school B-ORG
they O
were O
attending O
and O
risk O
all O
for O
Dalby B-GPE
! O

We O
were O
not O
happy O
but O
we O
certainly O
were O
not O
ready O
to O
give O
up O
and O
move O
back O
to O
the O
UK B-GPE
. O

( O
Not O
that O
we O
could O
as O
all O
our O
savings O
had O
gone O
- O
car O
, O
rental O
deposit O
and O
rent O
as O
well O
as O
basic O
living O
and O
a O
very O
weak O
£ O
. O

That O
was O
6 O
months O
ago O
and O
we O
are O
planning O
to O
stay O
here B-GPE
for O
a O
few O
more O
years O
. O

I O
have O
since O
got O
a O
full O
time O
teaching O
job O
at O
the O
same O
school B-ORG
and O
the O
kids O
have O
settled O
despite O
moving O
schools O
twice O
in O
8months O
. O

The O
school B-ORG
house B-FAC
is O
more O
than O
adequate O
and O
is O
situated O
on O
an O
agricultural O
campus B-LOC
with O
9 O
other O
houses O
. O

The O
rent O
is O
dirt O
cheap O
and O
our O
savings O
are O
slowly O
creeping O
back O
up O
again O
. O

mostly O
as O
there O
are O
no O
restaurants O
to O
speak O
of O
and O
any O
decent O
shops O
are O
at O
least O
an O
hours O
drive O
away O
! O

The O
house B-FAC
we O
left O
in O
the O
UK B-GPE
is O
almost O
finished O
and O
our O
next O
door O
neighbours O
want O
to O
buy O
it O
for O
their O
parents O
. O

We O
are O
not O
where O
we O
wanted O
to O
be O
and O
the O
boat O
is O
unlikely O
to O
see O
the O
ocean O
for O
a O
while O
. O
. O
. O
but O
we O
are O
doing O
ok O
. O

There O
is O
always O
a O
silver O
lining O
if O
you O
look O
for O
it O
and O
we O
are O
now O
looking O
at O
buying O
an O
expedition O
camper O
and O
going O
off O
road O
around O
Australia B-GPE
as O
we O
have O
gotten O
a O
taste O
of O
the O
outback B-LOC
. O

Yee O
ha O
! O

Excelent O
post O
mate B-PER
and O
just O
goes O
to O
show O
if O
you O
' O
re O
prepared O
to O
try O
anything O
it O
can O
work O
out O
in O

Glad O
to O

it O
has O
all O
worked O
out O
( O
apart O
from O
the O
boat O
' O

point O

) O

We O
drove O
from O
Sydney B-GPE
to O
Dalby B-GPE
to O
pick O
up O
our O
Border O
Collie O
puppy O
almost O
a O
year O
ago O
! O

Had O
never O
heard O
of O
the O
place B-GPE
before O
then O
. O

I O
liked O
it O
' O

rural O
charm O
! O

And O
was O
a O
nice O
drive O
from O
Brisbane B-GPE
up O
through O

Enjoy O
it O
for O
what O
it O
is O
for O

Enditem O

Best O
way O
to O
prevent O
Soros B-PER
funded O
thugs O
from O
breaking O
up O
Trump B-PER
rallies O

Seems O
very O
likely O
things O
will O
escalate O
into O
havoc O
and O
violence O
- O
Indeed O
, O
that O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
goal O
of O
the O
well O
known O
leftist O
nation O
wrecking O
foreign O
shill B-PER
Soros B-PER
. O

Hire O
inherently O
violent O
, O
unemployed O
and O
aimless O
minorities O
already O
whipped O
into O
an O
anti O
establishment O
frenzy O
by O
Obama B-PER
to O
agitate O
and O
intimidate O
, O
then O
when O
the O
* O
* O
* O
* O
hits O
the O
fan O
, O
blame O
it O
on O
the O
rhetoric O
of O
Trump B-PER
and O
claim O
the O
hired O
thugs O
were O
just O
peaceful O
, O
grass O
roots O
protesters O
who O
were O
innocently O
protesting O
and O
attacked O
by O
angry O
mobs O
of O
neo O
Nazi B-ORG
whites O
. O

So O
it O
would O
behoove O
those O
of O
us O
interested O
in O
the O
rule O
of O
law O
and O
1st O
amendment O
rights O
to O
find O
ways O
to O
prevent O
these O
anarchic O
3rd O
world O
rented O
left O
wing O
urban O
terrorists O
from O
doing O
their O
dirty O
work O
in O
this O
once O
great O
nation B-GPE
of O
ours O
, O
and O
a O
couple O
ideas O
come O
to O
mind O
. O

Charge O
anyone O
entering O
$ O
20 O
and O
require O
legal O
, O
state O
issued O
ID O
. O

That O
would O
ordinarily O
filter O
out O
about O
99 O
. O
9 O
% O
of O
them O
, O
but O
with O
the O
Soros B-PER
funding O
, O
they O
could O
easily O
get O
around O
the O
$ O
$ O
barrier O
. O

State O
ID O
barrier O
not O
so O
easy O
, O
that O
should O
filter O
out O
at O
least O
half O
to O
75 O
% O
of O
them O
. O

Add O
a O
requirement O
that O
those O
with O
felonies O
will O
not O
be O
allowed O
in O
, O
then O
we O
are O
back O
up O
to O
the O
90 O
% O
region O
in O
many O
locations O
, O
add O
drug O
screening O
and O
consistent O
100 O
% O
nation B-GPE
wide O
, O
, O
, O
But O
that O
would O
take O
alot O
of O
pre O
planning O
to O
accomplish O
, O
something O
not O
always O
feasible O
in O
campaign O
rallies O
. O

Then O
, O
they O
can O
" O
peacefully O
protest O
" O
outside O
until O
their O
cold O
little O
lizard O
hearts O
are O
content O
, O
and O
the O
$ O
$ O
raised O
by O
the O
rally O
would O
be O
donated O
to O
charity O
. O

Any O
more O
ideas O
? O

Can O
' O
t O
trust O
Trump B-PER
with O
the O
money O
. O

He O
says O
he O
raised O
$ O
6 O
million O
for O
veterans O
yet O
only O
~ O
$ O
2 O
, O
000 O
, O
000 O
of O
it O
has O
been O
donated O
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
think O
the O

earned O
from O
your O
stellar O

would O
ever O
make O
it O

Evidence O
of O

from O

remained O
everywhere O

Lots O
of O

of O

projects O
that O

We O
did O
notice O
some O
minimal O
expansion O

By O
comparison O
between O
the O

the O

On O
what O

They O
themselves O
do O
not O

to O
go O

they O
know O
that O
once O

you O

Well O

You O

Why O
in O
the O

Your O

was O
ridiculous O

Alabama B-GPE
didn O
' O

The O
eye O
actually O
made O
landfall O
in O
Louisiana B-GPE

Mississippi B-GPE
took O
the O

It O

steam O
cleaning O
charges O

Hoping O
someone O
can O
help O
me O
regarding O
fair O
charges O
for O
steam O
cleaning O
. O

Our O
container O
arrived O
recently O
and O
the O
NZ B-GPE
shipping O
agents O
have O
sent O
us O
a O
letter O
from O
biosecurity O
requiring O
two O
cars O
and O
two O
bikes O
to O
be O
steam O
cleaned O
. O

The O
charges O
seem O
pretty O
damn O
high O
. O

We O
have O
been O
quoted O
$ O
600NZD O
for O
each O
car O
, O
and O
$ O
275NZD O
for O
each O
bike O
. O

Particularly O
annoying O
was O
the O
fact O
that O
both O
the O
cars O
and O
bikes O
were O
cleaned O
before O
shipment O
. O

There O
is O
no O
way O
around O
this O
it O
seems O
. O

What O
made O
me O
laugh O
/ O
cry O
was O
to O
avoid O
the O
$ O
275 O
charge O
for O
cleaning O
each O
bike O
, O
we O
could O
pay O
$ O
375 O
each O
for O
destruction O
! O
! O
! O

Ouch O
! O

exactly O
how O
did O
you O
clean O
them O
in O
UK B-GPE
. O
. O
. O
? O

Did O
you O
get O
the O
underside O
done O
? O

Cars O
and O
bikes O
were O
steam O
cleaned O
! O

Underneath O
and O

done O

And O
inside O

Push O

? O

I O
don O
' O
t O
fancy O
having O
all O
my O
bikes O
( O
cycles O
) O
steam O
cleaned O

Bicycles O
. O

DAft O
question O
probably O
but O
did O
you O
provide O
the O
steam O
clean O
paperwork O
evidence O
when O
you O
submitted O
your O
MAF B-ORG
papers O
this O
end O
? O

The O
international O
movers O
did O
all O
the O
paperwork O
( O
except O
the O
forms O
I O
had O
to O
fill O
in O
) O
. O

We O
had O
the O
cars O
cleaned O
before O
taking O
them O
to O
the O
movers O
and O
they O
cleaned O
them O
again O
just O
to O
make O
sure O
. O

But O
we O
had O
no O
paperwork O
and O
I O
' O
m O
not O
sure O
if O
the O
movers O
provided O
any O
. O

Would O
this O
help O
next O
time O
? O

We O
have O
2 O
other O
cars O
and O
a O
container O
still O
to O
go O
, O
so O
if O
I O
can O
avoid O
this O
happening O
again O
, O
I O
will O
get O
paperwork O
if O
it O
would O
help O
. O

Thanks O
for O
the O
tip O
. O

we O
had O
our O
car O
professionally O
cleaned O
, O
I O
photographed O
it O
being O
done O
and O
left O
the O
paperwork O
and O
invoice O
visible O
in O
the O
car O
before O
it O
was O
put O
onto O
the O
container O
at O
our O
house B-FAC
. O

as O
for O
bikes O
we O
cleaned O
with O
Vikal O
, O
I O
think O
it O
was O
called O
, O
recommended O
by O
the O
removal O
firm B-ORG
but O
hear O
that O
Jeyes O
is O
also O
good O
. O

as O
long O
as O
it O
smells O
bleachy O
and O
looks O
clean O
from O
my O
should O
be O
all O
good O
. O

but O
then O
again O
you O
won O
' O
t O
know O
how O
long O
the O
container O
is O
going O
to O
stand O
still O
at O
anyone O
port O
, O
and O
what O
creepy O
crawlers O
are O
already O
on O
the O
container O
or O
will O
get O
on O
it O
so O
if O
MAF B-ORG
see O
cobwebs O
they O
are O
going O
to O
want O
it O
cleaned O
again O
anyway O
, O
thats O
my O
understanding O

Among O
those O
forms O
would O
have O
been O
the O
one O
where O
you O
declare O
anything O
that O
might O
be O
of O
interest O
to O
MAF B-ORG
and O
what O
you O
did O
to O
clean O
that O
. O

I O
think O

( O

link O
works O
) O

i O
. O
e O
. O

tools O
- O
cleaned O
with O
Jeyes O
fluid O
. O

Cars O
- O
steam O
cleaned O
by O
xxxx O

Walking O
boots O
etc O
. O

You O
would O
have O
filled O
that O
out O
and O
the O
Shipper O
would O
& O
amp O
; O
should O
have O
provided O
that O
to O
MAF B-ORG
with O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
paperwork O
. O

If O
the O
Shippers O
had O
the O
cars O
professionally O
cleaned O
then O
they O
should O
have O
the O
paperwork O
to O
cover O
that O
as O
it O
would O
be O
part O
of O
their O
accounts O
. O

Those O
fees O
seem O
a O
bit O
steep O
to O
me O
. O

that O

I O

I O
hadn O

cleaned O
either O
beforehand O
so O
I O
knew O
it O
was O
a O
risk O
. O

Also O
they O
had O
been O
in O
storage O
for O
2 O
years O
so O
the O

had O
cobwebs O
on O
. O

The O
MAFF B-ORG
clearance O

said O
they O
needed O
a O
vacuum O

wash O

Neither O
looked O
washed O
to O
me O
when O
I O
got O
them O
! O

Oddly O
, O
my O
garden O

, O
which O
they O
checked O
but O
didn O
' O
t O
clean O
, O
had O
cobwebs O
on O
too O
when O
it O
arrived O
. O

Thanks O
for O
the O

BEVS B-PER

I O
don O
' O
t O
think O
I O
completed O
that O
particular O
form O
but O
I O
did O
fill O
in O
an O
unaccompanied O
personal O

declaration O
. O

It O
included O
cars O
and O
bikes O
but O
did O
not O
specifically O
ask O
about O
cleanliness O

, O
so O
I O
didn O
' O
t O
state O
anything O
, O
nor O
did O
the O
shippers O
ask O
for O
any O
. O

Next O
time O
I O
will O
make O
sure O
to O
attach O
copy O

for O

MrsFychan B-PER

send O

I O
' O

I O
' O

for O

I O

not O

just O
take O
it O

five O

in O
a O
barbarous O
gang O
rape O
in O
the O
Indian B-GPE
capital B-GPE
last O
month O
, O
amid O
a O

fury O
calling O
for O
harsh O
punishment O
of O
the O
accused O
including O
execution O
. O

The O
Delhi B-ORG
Police I-ORG
filed O
the O
charges O
at O
the O
Saket B-FAC
court I-FAC
in O
south O
Delhi B-GPE
where O
the O
shocking O
gang O
rape O
took O
place O
on O
Dec O
. O
16 O
on O
a O
moving O
bus O
when O
the O
six O
thugs O
raped O
and O
tortured O
a O
23 O
- O

- O
old O
medical O
student B-PER
for O
more O
than O
half O
an O
hour O
before O
throwing O
the O
dying O
victim B-PER
and O
her O
boyfriend B-PER
onto O
a O
remote O
road B-FAC
naked O
. O

Police B-ORG
said O
the O
accused O
also O
tried O
to O
run O
over O
the O
two O
victims O
but O
the O
boy B-PER
pulled O
the O
woman B-PER
aside O
inches O
from O
the O
bus O
. O

The O
victim B-PER
died O
at O
a O
Singapore B-GPE
hospital B-FAC
last O
Saturday O
after O
suffering O
from O
multi O
- O
organic O
failures O
caused O
by O
fatal O
body O

damages O
inflicted O
by O
the O

, O
all O
of O
whom O
hailed O
from O
a O
stinking O
slum B-LOC
in O
south O
Delhi B-GPE

The O
accused O
were O
charged O
with O
murder O
, O
gang O
rape O
, O
unnatural O
assault O
, O
kidnapping O
, O
destruction O
of O
evidence O
and O
a O
number O
other O
offenses O
, O
which O
are O
considered O
serious O
enough O
for O
capital O
punishment O
by O
hanging O
. O

The O
Indian B-GPE
capital B-GPE
has O
been O
dipped O
into O
a O
deep O
melancholy O
after O
days O
of O
furious O
protests O
against O
the O
brutality O
. O

The O
sixth B-PER
of O
the O
accused O
, O
a O
juvenile B-PER
, O
will O
be O
charged O
at O
a O
juvenile O
court B-ORG
in O
accordance O
with O
the O

, O
said O

While O
anger O
of O
Indians O
remain O
unabated O
over O
the O
horrifying O
case O

authorities O
have O
promised O

guarantee O
justice O
for O
both O
the O
victim B-PER

the O
accused O
in O

However O
, O
if O
the O
accused O
were O
given O
any O
leniency O
, O
the O
public O
' O

anger O
would O
again O
break O
out O
in O
the O
streets O
as O
was O
seen O
over O
the O
past O
two O
weeks O
when O
the O
Indian B-GPE
capital B-GPE
experienced O
unprecedented O
protests O
by O
students O
and O
other O

at O
the O

PRA O
Meanwhile O
, O
the O
Indian B-GPE
government B-ORG
and O
the O
opposition B-ORG
are O
all O
posed O
to O
debate O
on O
a O
new O
anti O
- O
rape O
law O
to O
make O
harsher O
and O
more O
efficient O
punishment O
for O
rapists O
and O
women O
molesters O
. O

A O
government B-ORG
minister B-PER
has O
called O
for O
the O
naming O
of O
the O
proposed O
new O
law O
after O
the O
victim B-PER
of O
the O
Delhi B-GPE
gang O
rape O
. O

However O
, O
some O
Congress B-ORG
leaders O
have O
expressed O
opposition O
to O
the O
proposal O
by O
Minister O
of O
State B-GPE
of O

considered O

most O
outspoken O
government B-ORG
ministers O
. O

The O
gang O
rape O
has O
deeply O
shaken O
India B-GPE
and O
led O
to O
a O
national O
soul O
searching O
on O
how O
to O
better O
protest O
women O
against O
rapes O
and O
other O
violence O
, O
which O
are O
reported O
on O

, O
that O
was O
while O
I O
was O
at O
Leeds B-ORG

The O

waste O
anymore O
of O
the O

' O
s O
money O
on O
this O
piece B-PER
of O

The O
time O
he O
has O
spent O
inside O
roughly O
equates O
to O
2 O
years O
per O
woman B-PER
he O
killed O
. O

It O
costs O
something O
like O
50k O
a O
year O
to O
keep O
him O
in O
Broadmoor B-FAC
and O
only O
around O
12p O
to O
make O
one O
9mm O

which O
should O
be O
deposited O
squarely O
in O
his O

ing O

I O
don O
’ O
t O
normally O
support O
the O
death O
penalty O
, O
but O
in O
some O
cases O
it O
is O
probably O
the O
best O
solution O
. O

Keeping O
him O
alive O
in O
Broadmoor B-FAC
is O
probably O
more O
cruel O
and O
pointless O
than O
ending O
his O
life O
. O
, O
and O
the O
world B-LOC
is O
safer O
with O
him O
gone O

Let O
him O
out O

he O
was O
innocent O

His O
human O

He O

who O
obviously O
had O

Perhaps O
Dogbye B-PER

right O

He O
could O

It O
all O
sounds O
very O
good O
. O

But O
the O
only O
western B-LOC
industrialised O
country B-GPE
that O
' O
s O
still O
killing O
the O
killers O
in O
the O
stupid O
belief O
it O
actually O
works O
, O
has O
far O
different O
figures O

It O
actually O
costs O
more O
to O
execute O
than O
to O
keep O

FACT O
. O

This O
is O
a O
serious O
point O
from O
me O
. O

I O
had O
a O
girlfriend B-PER
who O
was O
later O
found O
guilty O
of O
murder O
. O

The O
evidence O
was O
totally O
circumstantial O
, O
and O
in O
my O
( O
perhaps O
biased O
) O
view O
not O
beyond O
reasonable O
doubt O
. O

She O
has O
always O
claimed O
her O
innocence O
, O
and O
because O
of O
that O
she O
was O
give O
a O
stinging O
sentence O
. O

She O
currently O
holds O
the O
longest O
sentence O
in O
the O
state B-GPE
. O

She O
is O
a O
110 O
% O
supporter B-PER
of O
the O
death O
penalty O
. O

When O
I O
asked O
why O
, O
she O
said O
“ O
because O
juries O
are O
more O
realistic O
when O
they O
think O
you O
will O
hang O
” O
. O

You O
cannot O
argue O
with O
her O
words O
. O

She O
had O
the O
most O
to O
lose O
. O

I O
can O
PM O
anyone O
details O
if O
they O
want O
. O

Given O
that O
the O
Uk B-GPE
used O
to O
do O
it O
within O
the O
month O
the O
costs O
here B-GPE
would O
be O
cheaper O

time O
the O

all O
their O

they O

up O

I O
see O
online O
sources O
say O
they O
are O
Somali B-GPE
, O
but O
they O
really O
don O
' O
t O
look O
Somali B-GPE
. O

if O
you O
watch O
the O
video O
of O
one B-PER
of O
the O

he O
sounds O
suspiciously O
London B-GPE
, O
maybe O
born O
elsewhere O
but O
certainly O
has O
grown O
up O
in O
London B-GPE
. O

Doesn O
' O
t O
really O
matter O
where O
they O
are O
from O
though O
, O
the O
fact O
they O
are O
referencing O
Allah O
is O
going O
to O
cause O
yet O
another O
backlash O
to O
the O
peaceful O
muslims O
living O
in O
UK B-GPE
. O

Sad O
times O
indeed O
. O

That O
' O
s O
murder O
, O
plain O
and O
simple O
! O

An O

for O

I O
say O
hang O
them O

My O
thoughts O
to O
the O
person B-PER
' O
s O
poor O
family O
going O
through O
such O
a O
horrible O
time O
right O
now O
! O

And O
practically O
seeing O
the O
death O
on O
TV O
. O

Truly O
awful O
. O

It O
is O
times O
like O
this O
that O
we O
could O
learn O
from O
the O
ME O
laws O
as O
I O
guarantee O
they O
would O
be O
dead O
inside O
a O
year O
. O

Though O
as O
fundamentalists O
are O
we O
better O
to O
keep O
them O
alive O
( O
and O
let O
leroy B-PER
and O
his O
jail O
boys O
say O
hello O
everyday O
) O
so O
they O
do O
not O
die O
a O
martyr O
to O
other O
fundamentalists O
? O

Death O
is O
too O
good O
for O
them O
; O
I O
am O
all O
for O
letting O
them O
rot O
in O
jail O
for O
life O
. O

So O
sad O
, O
what O
a O
way O
to O
die O
. O

My O
thoughts O
are O
with O
his O
family O
and O
friends O
. O

My O
only O
hope O
is O
that O
this O
is O
one O
off O
situation O
? O

But O
i O
doubt O
it O
, O
here O
is O
a O
little O
bit O
of O

on O
islamic O
terrorist O

the O
way O
the O
murderer B-PER
comes O
back O
on O
camera O
and O
tries O
to O
apologize O
and O
explain O
himself O
. O

Maybe O
the O
peaceful O
Muslims O
should O
distance O
themselves O
from O
these O
nutcases O
and O
their O
nutcase O
preachers O
and O
the O
places O
of O

where O
the O
hatred O
is O
spouted O

let O
the O

presidency O
would O
the O
last O
straw O
. O

Not O
sure O
going O
back O
to O
the O
UK B-GPE
is O
brilliant O
idea O
but O
I O
understand O
the O
sentiment O
. O

People O
of O
various O
political O
leanings O
in O
many O
countries O
have O
promised O
to O
leave O
should O
" O
X O
" O
be O
elected O
for O
years O
, O
decades O
even O
. O

I O
have O
yet O
to O
ever O
see O
one O
who O
actually O
followed O
through O
. O

Hang O
on O
, O
according O
to O
this O
Phil B-PER
Collins I-PER
really O
did O
leave O
. O

But O
apparently O
no O
one O
noticed O
. O

Trump B-PER
is O
unlikely O
even O
to O
get O
the O
GOP B-ORG
nomination O
let O
alone O
the O
big O
prize O
. O

I O
heard O
the O
same O
rhetoric O
when O
Obama B-PER
was O
first O
elected O
. O

There O
will O
be O
lots O
of O
talk O
and O
teeth O
gnashing O
with O
very O
little O
action O
. O

It O
could O
be O
worse O
, O
what O
if O
that O
woman B-PER
gets O
elected O

Hope O
you O
are O
right O
, O
we O
begin O
to O
find O
out O
soon O
but O
I O
suspect O
it O
might O
be O
a O
convention O
nomination O
for O
at O
least O
the O
GOP B-ORG
and O
if O
Sanders B-PER
can O
get O
the O
momentum O
really O
rolling O
, O
the O
Dems B-ORG
as O
well O
. O

Just O
hope O
its O
not O
Cruz B-PER
or O
Trump B-PER
. O

I O
thought O
he O
was O
leading O
the O
polls O
and O
favorite B-PER
with O
the O
bookies O
? O

Which O
is O
essentially O
meaningless O
right O
now O
. O

I O
' O
m O
too O
settled O
here B-GPE
to O
think O
about O
leaving O
. O

My O
wife B-PER
wouldn O
' O
t O
want O
to O
leave O
the O
US B-GPE
anyway O
since O
she O
was O
born O
here B-GPE
. O

California B-GPE
is O
a O
strongly O
Democrat B-ORG
State B-GPE
and O
Trump B-PER
' O
s O
policies O
wouldn O
' O
t O
interfere O
much O
with O
the O
internal O
running O
of O
this O
State B-GPE
. O

The O
main O
thing O
to O
remember O
also O
is O
that O
he O
' O
s O
got O
4 O
years O
. O
. O
no O
more O
. O

If O
he O
nominates O
Palin B-PER
for O
his O
VP O
he O
wont O
even O
get O
that O

Why O
would O
you O
leave O
? O

If O
certain O
things O
changes O
, O
then O
maybe O
that O
would O
be O
a O
time O
to O
think O
about O
it O
, O
but O
an O
election O
may O
change O
who O
is O
in O
power O
, O
but O
can O
they O
do O
anything O
with O
that O
power O
, O
whether O
via O
the O
system O
or O
the O
inclination O
. O

If O
Trump B-PER
did O
win O
, O
I O
' O
d O
venture O
he O
will O
calm O
down O
and O
realize O
he O
won O
' O
t O
have O
the O
powers O
he O
thinks O
he O
will O
to O
willy O
nilly O
change O
things O
. O

Candidates O
always O
seem O
to O
talk O
big O
, O
then O
realize O
once O
they O
win O
, O
how O
much O
they O
actually O
cannot O
do O
. O

He O
' O
ll O
fire O
anyone O
who O
gets O
in O
his O
way O
! O

It O
really O
depends O
what O
happens O
to O
Congress B-ORG
. O

Without O
the O
support O
of O
both O
the O
House B-ORG
and O
Senate B-ORG
it O
is O
difficult O
for O
the O
President O
to O
do O
much O
, O
with O
the O
support O
of O
neither O
the O
task O
becomes O
much O
harder O
. O

This O
has O
been O
the O
pattern O
for O
most O
of O
the O
past O
23 O
years O
- O
Bill B-PER
Clinton I-PER
faced O
a O
hostile O
congress B-ORG
for O
much O
of O
his O
presidency O
, O
George B-PER
W I-PER
Bush I-PER
was O
out O
of O
step O
with O
his O
own O
party B-ORG
and O
achieved O
relatively O
little O
, O
and O
since O
the O
Tea B-ORG
Party I-ORG
revolution O
in O
2010 O
President O
Obama B-PER
hasn O
' O
t O
been O
able O
to O
do O
much O
either O
- O
his O
landmark O
achievement O
of O
the O
Affordable O
Care O
Act O
is O
pretty O
much O
his O
only O
memorable O
achievement O
. O

FWIW O
I O
left O
the O
UK B-GPE
as O
soon O
as O
I O
could O
after O
Tony B-PER
Blair I-PER
' O

hapless O

Tony B-PER

Holder B-PER
called O
for O
immediate O
congressional B-ORG
action O
, O
to O
make O
" O
significant O
strides O
in O
reducing O
the O
violence O
that O
too O
often O
fills O
our O
headlines O
and O
afflicts O
our O
communities O

" O

" O
Some O
have O
said O
that O
these O
changes O
will O
require O
tough O
votes O
, O
by O
members O
of O
Congress B-ORG
. O

As O
you O
all O
know O
, O
public O
service O
is O
never O
easy O
, O
and O
there O
come O
times O
when O
those O
of O
us O
who O
are O
elected O
or O
appointed O
to O
positions O
must O
put O
the O
interests O
of O
those O
who O
we O
serve O
- O
- O
who O
we O
are O
privileged O
to O
serve O
, O
above O
that O
which O
might O
be O
politically O
expedient O
or O
professionally O
safe O
. O

This O
is O
one O
of O
those O
times O
, O

said O

who O
will O
stay O
on O

the O
head B-PER
of O

Department I-ORG
in O
Obama B-PER
' O

The O
Attorney B-PER
General I-PER
urged O
lawmakers O
to O
enact O
the O
" O
common O
- O
sense O
legislations O
" O
which O
President O
Barack B-PER
Obama I-PER
announced O
on O
Wednesday O
, O
including O
universal O

checks O
of O
gun O
sales O
and O
bans O
on O
military O
- O
style O
weapons O
and O
high O

. O

The O
gun O
reform O
could O
begin O
with O
completing O
the O
background O
checks O
system O
, O
a O
" O
relatively O
simple O
step O
" O
, O
said O
Holder B-PER
. O

" O
Congress B-ORG
should O
move O
swiftly O
to O
adopt O
legislation O
to O
require O
universal O
background O
checks O
so O
that O
a O
full O
background O
check O
is O
conducted O
every O
time O
someone O
attempts O
to O
buy O
a O
gun O
, O
" O
said O
Holder B-PER
. O

He O
encouraged O
more O
private O
sellers O
to O
work O
with O
licensed O
dealers O
to O
ensure O
that O
all O
sales O
are O
subject O
to O
a O
comprehensive O
background O
check O

Obama B-PER
on O
Wednesday O
unveiled O
a O

, O
a O

Hook I-FAC
Elementary I-FAC
School I-FAC
mass O
shooting O
that O
killed O
26 O
people O
including O
20 O

The O
measures O
include O
23 O
executive O
actions O
which O
the O
president B-PER
signed O
at O
the O
scene O
, O
and O
proposals O
that O
require O

The O

assembled O
by O
a O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
task O
force O
headed O
by O
Vice O

effort O
in O
the O
United B-GPE

in O
nearly O
two O

. O

However O
, O
much O

meet O

on O

where O

As O
most O
of O
you O
know O
I O

You O
' O
ll O
need O
a O
car O

My O
friend B-PER
hired O
a O
car O
via O

at O
a O
better O
rate O
that O
the O
hire O
companies O
when O
they O
first O
came O
but O
that O
was O
over O
in O
QLD B-GPE
. O

Have O
you O
got O
a O
job O
to O
come O
to O
? O

- O
it O
will O
take O
longer O
that O
a O
month O
to O
secure O
work O
if O
you O
don O
' O
t O
have O
anything O
lined O
up O
. O

Heaps O
of O
Irish O
in O
Perth B-GPE
if O
that O
' O
s O
where O
your O
going O
there B-GPE
. O

check O
out O
gum O
tree O
- O
but O
beware O
lots O
of O
scam O
on O
that O
site O
too O
. O

Good O
luck O
with O

etc O
. O

Poitin B-PER

Yeah O
I O
would O
be O
joining O

so O
a O
guaranteed O
job O

Your O
figures O
don O
' O
t O
look O
far O
off O
Irish B-PER
, O
maybe O
a O
little O
more O
on O
the O
visa O
cost O

Obviously O
some O
cash O
for O
food O
and O
travel O
before O
you O
get O
paid O
as O
well O
- O
are O
you O
thinking O
of O
purchasing O
a O
car O
here B-GPE
or O
using O
public O
? O

If O
you O
let O
an O
airline O
know O
you O
are O
migrating O

have O
an O

you O
may O
get O

we O
did O
with O

which O
helps O

I O
know O
someone B-PER
who O
moved O
to O
Canberra B-GPE
and O
shipped O
their O
car O
over O
. O

Is O
that O
a O
feasible O
option O
? O

It O
certainly O
seems O
like O
it O
could O
be O
much O
cheaper O
to O
ship O
your O
car O
and O
re O
register O
rather O
than O
buy O
/ O
rent O
when O
you O
arrive O
. O

I O
was O
considering O
shipping O
the O
car O
over O
but O
then O
had O
heard O
it O
cost O
somewhere O
in O
the O

of O
about O
£ O
3k O
? O
? O

There O
' O

a O
thread O
around O
somewhere O
if O
you O
use O

As O

If O
its O

I O

I O
refuse O

entirely O
different O

Just O
look O
at O
how O

he O
was O
at O

there O

Hello O
stranger B-PER

How O
did O
they O
know O
it O
was O
less O
than O
a O
year O
old O
? O

Did O
you O
have O
to O
declare O
it O
? O

Our O
telly O
is O
18 O
months O
old O
so O
no O
probs O
but O
our O
washing O
machine O
is O
only O
3 O
months O
old O
. O

You O
should O
declare O
anything O
under O
12 O
months O
old O
x O

Well O
I O
had O
a O
40ft O
container O
of O
household O
items O
of O
furniture O
and O
most O
of O
it O
under O
12 O
months O
old O
or O
new O
( O
bedding O
light O
fittings O
curtains O
etc O
) O
. O

I O
then O
bought O
a O
rangemaster O
cooker O
and O
had O
that O
sent O
direct O
to O
shippers B-ORG
and O
none O
of O
this O
was O
declared O
as O
new O
and O
all O
went O
through O
without O
any O
problems O
. O

Customs B-ORG
inspected O
the O
container O
and O
never O
blinked O
an O
eye O
- O
even O
though O
several O
large O
items O
( O
cooker O
- O
garden O
settings O
etc O
) O
were O
all O
brand O
new O
and O
in O
original O
packing O
. O

Two O
leather O
sofas O
under O
12 O
months O
old O
and O
a O
dining O
suite O
also O
included O
. O

the O
only O
items O
they O
actually O
looked O
at O
were O
christmas O
decorations O
and O
the O
kept O
two O
back O
because O
one O
santa O
had O
twine O
around O
him O
- O
oh O
and O
one O
bell O
had O
fake O
berries O
on O
it O
( O
go O
figure O
that O
one O
) O
! O

Yes O
, O
indeed O
. O

We O
brought O
a O
brand O
new O
tumble O
dryer O
over O
and O
paid O
duty O
on O
it O

It O
was O
small O

So O
. O
. O
. O
why O
? O

Has O
the O
average O
American B-GPE
worker O
suddenly O
become O
more O
globally O
competitive O
overnight O
? O

What O
is O
Apple B-ORG
' O
s O
incentive O
? O

THIS O
is O
the O
ONLY O
question O
that O
matters O
. O

A O
few O
points O
about O
article O
. O

It O
is O
well O
written O
and O
logically O
structured O
. O

I O
only O
skimmed O
it O
, O
but O
I O
only O
caught O
one O
typo O
( O
look O
for O
' O
tought O
' O
) O

However O
. O

While O
you O
mention O
the O
quote O
from O
the O
NY O
Times O
about O
how O
it O
wasn O
' O
t O
the O
cost O
of O
labour O
that O
gives O
China B-GPE
it O
' O
s O
edge O
in O
attracting O
the O
assembly O
jobs O
, O
but O
the O
flexibility O
in O
creating O
supply O
chains O
and O
the O
flexibility O
of O
the O
factories O
- O
you O
don O
' O
t O
really O
address O
the O
issue O
. O

Your O
article O
talks O
about O
how O
China B-GPE
bent O
over O
backwards O
to O
create O
a O
factory B-FAC
for O
Gorilla O
glass O
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
compare O
that O
to O
a O
story O
on O
the O
MacRumours O
front O
page O
where O
Apple B-ORG
' O
s O
campus B-FAC
in O
Austin B-GPE
wants O
to O
expand O
, O
but O
the O
various O
levels O
of O
government O
can O
' O
t O
agree O
on O
what O
level O
of O
incentives O
to O
provide O
. O

Your O
article O
also O
ignores O
the O
statements O
that O
in O
China B-GPE
can O
recruit O
several O
hundred O
low O
- O
level O
engineers O
in O
a O
matter O
of O
days O
, O
if O
not O
hours O
. O

Basically O
, O
engineers O
with O
a O
technical O
college O
diploma O
. O

While O
in O
the O
US B-GPE
it O
would O
take O
them O
weeks O
if O
not O
months O
to O
recruit O
those O
numbers O
in O
a O
community O
where O
they O
could O
also O
afford O
the O
land O
. O

So O
. O
. O
. O
. O
while O
Apple B-ORG
may O
be O
able O
to O
recruit O
those O
engineers O
in O
LA B-GPE
or O
NY B-GPE
. O
. O
. O
. O
could O
they O
afford O
the O
real O
estate O
to O
locate O
a O
factory O
there O
? O

And O
in O
places O
where O
they O
can O
afford O
to O
locate O
a O
factory O
, O
are O
there O
enough O
engineers O
who O
already O
live O
there O
or O
who O
would O
move O
- O
at O
their O
own O
expense O
? O

Many O
parts O
of O
an O
Apple B-ORG
device O
are O
in O
fact O
manufactured O
in O
the O
US B-GPE
. O
. O
. O
. O
primarily O
chips O
. O

It O
' O
s O
the O
assembly O
that O
is O
happening O
in O
China B-GPE
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
spin O
- O
off O
supplier O
benefits O
are O
in O
the O
US B-GPE
. O

And O
finally O
. O
. O
. O
. O
just O
because O
they O
can O
. O
. O
. O
why O
should O
they O
? O

One O
of O
the O
reasons O
the O
US B-GPE
was O
able O
to O
become O
so O
rich O
was O
by O
opening O
up O
other O
countries O
to O
American B-GPE
trade O
. O

Often O
those O
countries O
were O
reluctant O
to O
give O
up O
their O
own O
domestic O
manufacturing O
in O
exchange O
for O
American B-GPE
imports O
, O
and O
the O
US B-GPE
would O
bully O
or O
even O
use O
force O
to O
open O
them O
up O
to O
" O
free O
trade O
" O
. O

Free O
Trade O
is O
Free O
Trade O
- O
and O
the O
USA B-GPE
can O
' O
t O
just O
decide O
to O
change O
the O
rules O
because O
it O
is O
now O
being O
out O
- O
compteted O
. O

Learn O
to O
compete O
. O
. O
. O
don O
' O
t O
close O
the O
gates O
. O

I O
would O
point O
out O
that O
Samsung B-ORG
says O
one O
of O
the O
main O
reasons O
they O
built O
their O
chip O
factories O
in O
Austin B-GPE
Texas B-GPE
, O
is O
because O
of O
the O
quantity O
of O
talent O
available O
from O
the O
local O
University B-ORG
of I-ORG
Texas I-ORG
Engineering O
School B-ORG
. O

However O
, O
I O
don O
' O
t O
believe O
the O
need O
for O
" O
hundreds O
of O
engineers O
" O
at O
Foxconn B-ORG
. O

I O
think O
it O
was O
more O
like O
the O
need O
at O
the O
time O
to O
satisfy O
Steve B-PER
Jobs I-PER
' O
desire O
for O

whenever O
he O
wanted O
a O
last O
minute O

. O

Unions O
killed O
that O
idea O
50 O
+ O
years O
ago O
. O

The O
average O
North B-LOC
American I-LOC
worker O
is O
longer O
interested O
in O
working O
as O
hard O
as O
factory O
workers O
do O
in O
China B-GPE
. O

I O
think O
the O
' O
hundreds O
of O
engineers O
' O
needed O
is O
directly O
related O
to O
the O
tens O
of O
thousand O
of O
assembly O
line O
workers O
that O
Foxconn B-ORG
has O
employed O
. O

The O
more O
I O
read O
, O
the O
more O
I O
am O
convinced O
those O
of O
us O
in O
the O
" O
western B-LOC

" O
cannot O
conceive O
the O
scale O
of O

250k O

You O

they O
Provincial O
or O
Federal O
don O
' O
t O
bargain O
in O
good O
faith O
with O
their O
employees O
. O

What O
does O
good O
faith O
mean O
? O

They O
are O
trying O
to O
get O
the O
best O
deal O
for O
the O
taxpayers O
and O
students O
while O
the O
union B-ORG
is O
trying O
to O
get O
the O
best O
for O
itself O
and O
its O
members O
. O

Both O
engage O
in O
the O
manipulation O
of O
public O
opinion O
to O
further O
their O
own O
interests O
. O

I O
find O
myself O
agreeing O
with O
you O
. O

Public O
employees O
do O
get O
a O
pretty O
sweet O
deal O
compared O
to O
private O
sector O
. O

Good O
faith O
means O
going O
into O
negotiations O
without O
telling O
the O
other O
party O
that O
this O
is O
what O
we O
are O
prepared O
to O
impose O
on O
you O
and O
if O
you O
don O
' O
t O
agree O
we O
will O
legislate O
you O
back O
to O
work O
. O

Sure O
both O
use O
tactics O
to O
the O
benefit O
of O
whom O
they O
represent O
but O
Im O
pretty O
sure O
if O
the O
Govt B-ORG
came O
in O
and O
said O
Hey O
BC B-GPE
teachers O
we O
are O
reducing O
your O
wages O
by O
25 O
% O
take O
it O
or O
leave O
it O
Im O
pretty O
sure O
the O
taxpayers O
and O
students O
might O
agree O
with O
this O
. O

Would O
you O
as O
a O
teacher O
? O

There O
is O
always O
room O
for O
compromise O
and O
even O
the O
Unions O
understand O
this O
. O

Then O
all O
options O
in O
good O
faith O
should O
be O
on O
the O
table O
. O

We O
’ O
ll O
give O
you O
the O
percentage O
raise O
you O
want O
, O
but O
you O
agree O
to O
work O
full O
time O
and O
and O
take O
four O
weeks O
holiday O
, O
that O
way O
we O
can O
recoup O
the O
money O
lost O
by O
charging O
for O
the O
classes O
you O
’ O
ll O
have O
to O
teach O
in O
the O
extra O
two O

And O
how O
about O
giving O
back O
those O
Pro O

days O
and O
doing O
any O
further O

on O
your O

? O

I O
wouldn O
' O
t O
say O
the O
teachers O

bargains O
in O
good O

either O
, O
they O
can O

pretty O

I O
' O

open O

And O
every O
time O
they O
do O
it O
, O
they O
pay O
a O
fraction O
of O

by O

that O

costs O
consumers O
billions O

The O
story O
of O
how O
this O
works O
begins O
in O
27 O
industrial O
warehouses O
in O
the O
Detroit B-GPE
area B-LOC
where O
Goldman B-ORG
stores O

’ O
aluminum O

Each O

shuffles O
1 O
, O
500 O
- O
pound O
bars O
of O
the O
metal O
among O
the O
warehouses O
. O

This O
industrial O
dance O
has O
been O
choreographed O
by O
Goldman B-ORG
to O
exploit O
pricing O
regulations O
set O
up O
by O
an O

, O

back O

forth O
lengthens O
the O
storage O

And O
that O
adds O
many O
millions O
a O
year O
to O
the O
coffers O
of O
Goldman B-ORG
, O
which O
owns O
the O
warehouses O
and O
charges O
rent O
to O
store O
the O
metal O
. O

It O
also O
increases O
prices O
paid O
by O
manufacturers O
and O
consumers O
across O
the O
country B-GPE

Tyler B-PER
Clay I-PER
, O
a O
forklift O
driver B-PER
who O
worked O
at O
the O
Goldman B-ORG
warehouses O
until O
early O
this O
year O
, O
called O
the O
process O
“ O
a O
merry O
- O
go O
- O
round O
of O
metal O
. O
” O

Only O
a O
tenth O
of O
a O
cent O
or O
so O
of O
an O
aluminum O
can O
’ O
s O
purchase O
price O
can O
be O
traced O
back O
to O
the O
strategy O
. O

But O
multiply O
that O
amount O
by O
the O
90 O
billion O
aluminum O
cans O
consumed O
in O
the O
United B-GPE
States I-GPE
each O
year O
- O
and O
add O
the O
tons O
of O
aluminum O
used O
in O
things O
like O
cars O
, O
electronics O
and O
house O
siding O
- O
and O
the O
efforts O
by O
Goldman B-ORG
and O
other O
financial O
players O
has O
cost O
American B-GPE
consumers O
more O
than O
$ O
5 O
billion O
over O
the O
last O
three O
years O
, O
say O
former O
industry O
executives O
, O
analysts O
and O
consultants O
. O

The O
inflated O
aluminum O
pricing O
is O
just O
one O
way O
that O
Wall O
Street O
is O
capitalizing O
on O
loosened O
federal O
regulations O
to O
sway O
a O
variety O
of O
commodities O
markets O
, O
according O
to O
financial O
records O
, O
regulatory O
documents O
and O
interviews O
with O
people O
involved O
in O
the O
activities O
. O

The O
maneuvering O
in O
markets O
for O
oil O
, O
wheat O
, O
cotton O
, O
coffee O
and O
more O
have O
brought O
billions O
in O
profits O
to O
investment O

while O
forcing O

to O
pay O
more O

says O
it O
complies O
with O
all O
industry O
standards O
and O
there O
is O
no O

that O

, O
which O

for O
this O

Can O

I O
bought O
a O

plus O
space O
grey O
and O
found O
someone B-PER
that O
will O
trade O
for O
his O
iphone O
6 O

in O
silver O

We O
both O
bought O
our O
phones O
at O

both O
have O

We O
will O
be O
meeting O
at O
an O
apple B-ORG

to O
make O
sure O
each O
others O
phones O
are O
good O
to O
go O

The O
only O
thing O
im O
unsure O
of O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
my O
phone O
was O
purchased O
via O
att B-ORG
next O
. O

Will O
thie O
cause O
any O
problems O
with O
our O
trade O
? O

I O
was O
told O
that O
we O
could O
both O
cancel O
our O
applecares O
at O
the O
apple B-ORG
store B-FAC
then O
repurchase O
the O
applecare O
after O
the O
trade O
. O

I O
would O
just O
return O
it O
straight O
up O
at O
apple B-ORG
store O
but O
they O
don O
' O
t O
stock O
a O
silver O
6 O
plus O
anywhere O
near O
my O
city B-GPE
. O

Ask O
your O
carrier B-ORG
. O

Went O
to O
the O
apple B-ORG
store B-FAC
and O
completed O
the O
trade O
. O

It O
was O
no O
problem O
. O

We O
ran O
the O
diagnostics O
, O
returned O
our O
applecare O
and O
repurchased O
applecare O
under O
our O
new O
phones O
and O
called O
it O
a O
day O
. O

What O
are O
my O
options O
, O
opinions O
please O
! O

Hi O
everyone O
, O

Firstly O
a O
little O
background O
, O
i O
joined O
this O
fine O
site O
quite O
a O
while O
ago O
, O
and O
received O
a O
very O
warm O
welcome O
! O

but O
have O
not O
posted O
in O
a O
while O
( O
lurked O
a O
lot O
) O
. O

My O
wife B-PER
and O
i O
decided O
upon O
her O
renewing O
her O
american B-GPE
citizenship O
to O
move O
to O
milwaukee B-GPE
, O
WI B-GPE
. O

She O
is O
an O
american B-GPE
born O
abroad O
, O
so O
, O
blah O
blah O
, O
skip O
to O
the O
middle O
! O

She O
has O
been O
living O
there B-GPE
since O
january O
of O
last O
year O
, O
and O
i O
am O
currently O
living O
at O
my O
mothers B-PER
tiny O
house B-FAC
( O
in O
the O
bedroom B-FAC
i O
grew O
up O
in O
! O

I O
have O
visited O
twice O
within O
that O
time O
, O
each O
visit O
lasting O
a O
month O
, O
now O
, O
my O
point O
is O
, O
my O
immigration O
process O
is O
taking O
so O
long O
! O

and O
i O
don O
' O
t O
want O
to O
come O
across O
like O
so O
many O
posters O
who O
expect O
it O
to O
be O
immediate O
, O
but O
its O
been O
around O
eighteen O
months O
now O
and O
although O
it O
seems O
close O
to O
the O
end O
with O
a O
couple O
of O
delays O
, O
form O
resubmission O
( O
my O
wifes B-PER
tax O
and O
earnings O
) O
its O
made O
us O
consider O
a O
couple O
of O
options O
, O
bearing O
? O

baring O
? O

in O
mind O
i O
' O
ve O
been O
doing O
some O
research O
and O
it O
seems O
that O
the O
government B-ORG
shutdown O
will O
potentially O
delay O
it O
even O
further O
! O

oh O
yeah O
, O
both O
options O
involve O
me O
quitting O
my O
job O
of O
twelve O
years O
, O
ulp O
! O

option O
1 O
; O
I O
go O
for O
the O
full O
ninety O
days O
, O
starting O
at O
christmas O
, O
which O
means O
i O
can O
spend O
christmas O
and O
wait O
out O
some O
more O
of O
the O
time O
there B-GPE
with O
my O
wife B-PER
. O

option O
2 O
; O
which O
is O
a O
tad O
bigger O
and O
more O
in O
need O
of O
your O
guidance O
, O
is O
it O
possible O
to O
move O
there B-GPE
permanently O
and O
change O
or O
resubmit O
my O
visa O
as O
an O
adjustment O
of O
status O
instead O
? O

Obviously O
i O
' O
m O
not O
rushing O
into O
a O
decision O
by O
any O
means O
, O
it O
' O
s O
just O
really O
hard O
for O
us O
at O
the O
moment O
as O
we O
' O
ve O
been O
together O
for O
nearly O
twenty O
years O
and O
this O
is O
the O
longest O
we O
' O
ve O
been O
separated O
since O
we O
were O
18 O
! O

sorry O
for O
the O
essay O
and O
terrible O
grammar O
, O
but O
opinions O
would O
be O
much O
appreciated O

many O
thanks O

Eighteen O
months O
seems O
rather O
long O
- O
do O
you O
know O
where O
you O
are O
in O
the O
process O
? O

What O
responses O
from O
USCIS B-ORG
have O
you O
had O
? O

USCIS B-ORG
is O
funded O
from O
the O
fees O
it O
charges O
so O
isn O
' O
t O
directly O
affected O
by O
the O
shutdown O
. O

However O
, O
some O
steps O
in O
the O
process O
require O
action O
by O
other O
federal O
authorities O
such O
as O
FBI B-ORG
background O
checks O
, O
and O
they O
may O
be O
affected O
if O
they O
' O
ve O
not O
been O
done O
yet O
. O

Hi O
rpjs B-PER
, O

the O
last O
thing O
we O
submitted O
was O
the O
affidavit O
of O
support O
, O
twice O
because O
my O
wife B-PER
got O
a O
new O
teaching O
contract O
in O
the O
time O
they O
took O
so O
her O
tax O
didn O
' O
t O
match O
. O

that O
was O
in O
may O
, O
they O
haven O
' O
t O
been O
forthcoming O
with O
info O
at O
all O
throughout O
the O
process O
really O
mainly O
through O
instructing O
us O
to O
wait O
for O
an O
email O
that O
never O
arrives O
, O
so O
we O
call O
them O
and O
they O
tell O
us O
we O
should O
have O
already O
done O
the O
thing O
we O
were O
waiting O
on O
the O
email O
for O
! O

really O
frustrating O
. O

and O
with O
my O
wife B-PER
getting O
a O
new O
life O
sorted O
out O
on O
her O
own O
and O
all O
the O
complications O
that O
go O
with O
that O
, O
we O
' O
ve O
not O
been O
exactly O
hot O
on O
their O
heels O
, O
it O
has O
dragged O
it O
out O
a O
lot O
. O

but O
i O
would O
say O
we O
' O
re O
in O
the O
final O
stages O
now O
, O
but O
it O
seems O
we O
' O
ve O
been O
in O
the O
final O
stages O
for O
nearly O
a O
year O
, O
since O
i O
submitted O
my O
big O
pack O
of O
documents O

Do O
you O
have O
a O
Lawyer O
involved O
? O

You O
are O
probably O
only O
2 O
- O
3 O
months O
away O
from O
the O
visa O
now O
, O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
you O
have O
no O
further O
options O
open O
to O
you O
why O
would O
you O
want O
to O
stop O
it O
? O

The O
AoS O
from O
VWP O
is O
doomed O
to O
failure O
, O
since O
you O
are O
already O
married O
it O
' O
s O
pretty O
clear O
you O
would O
have O
immigrant O
intent O
, O
and O
if O
the O
AoS O
was O
refused O
for O
any O
reason O
you O
would O
become O
immediately O
removable O
and O
possibly O
receive O
a O
ban O
. O

Stick O
with O
it O
- O
you O
' O
re O
nearly O
there O
. O

we O
lucked O
out O
there O
although O
only O
recently O
, O
a O
friend B-PER
of O
my O
wife B-PER
is O
an O
immigration O
lawyer B-PER
! O

but O
she O
only O
met O
him O
very O
recently O
as O
i O
said O

I O
am O
curious O
to O
know O
how O
your O
wife B-PER
renewed O
her O

up O
many O

Fixed O
that O
for O
you O

Apple B-ORG
isn O
' O
t O
alone O

I O
never O
said O
Apple B-ORG
was O
alone O
I O
even O
stated O
some O
of O
the O
other O
companies O
mentioned O
that O
employed O
Foxconn B-ORG

Yup O
and O
I O
don O
' O
t O
lose O
sleep O
over O
it O

I O
know O
apple B-ORG
factories O
are O
not O
pleasant O
but O
no O
other O
company O
treats O
their O
employees O
well O
either O
, O
I O
think O
as O
consumers O
we O
need O
to O
make O
the O
choice O
of O
buying O
things O
made O
in O
North B-LOC
America I-LOC
at O
a O
higher O
price O
vs O
. O
things O
made O
in O
China B-GPE
at O
a O
lower O
price O
. O

With O
the O
costs O
of O
many O
things O
going O
up O
I O
do O
not O
think O
we O
as O
consumers O
can O
afford O
higher O
costs O
. O

I O
, O
purposely O
try O
to O
buy O
things O
made O
in O
Canada B-GPE
or O
USA B-GPE
. O

We O
are O
all O
to O
blame O
at O
this O
mess O
- O
consumers O
wanting O
cheap O
goods O
, O
Wal B-ORG
Mart I-ORG

other O
big O
box O

things O
, O
and O
the O
chinese B-GPE
governments B-ORG
openness O
to O
these O
horrible O
factories O
. O

Also O
manufacturing O
of O
goods O
in O
china B-GPE
dwindles O
the O

in O
America B-GPE

Also O
stuff O
made O

what O

Would O
the O

would O
the O

Well O
according O
to O
the O
article O
you O
could O
help O
out O
by O
not O
buying O
a O
product O
as O
soon O
as O
a O
new O
one O
comes O
out O
. O

Well O
i O
' O
m O
not O
entirely O
certain O
the O
impression O
that O
I O
got O
was O
that O
the O
conditions O
are O
especially O
harsh O
because O
the O
company B-ORG
is O
trying O
to O
meet O
increasing O
demand O
. O

If O
people O
didn O
' O
t O
swarm O
to O
buy O
the O
newest O
product O
every O
time O
they O
are O
released O
the O
demand O
for O
products O
wouldn O
' O
t O
be O
as O
high O
and O
the O
workers O
would O
not O
be O
worked O
as O
hard O
. O

Isn O
' O
t O
replacing O
" O
When O
the O
next O
on O
comes O
out O
. O
" O

and O
" O
is O
no O
longer O
current O
" O
the O
same O
thing O
? O

I O
replace O
mine O
when O
it O
is O
no O
longer O
performs O
the O
tasks O
I O
want O
it O
to O
or O
need O
it O
to O
perform O
. O

If O
it O
has O
failed O
I O
replace O
it O
if O
the O
cost O
to O
benefit O
ration O
of O
a O
new O
model O
outweighs O
the O
cost O
to O
benefit O
ratio O
of O
repairing O
it O
. O

Though O
I O
generally O
buy O
used O
products O
at O
a O
heavy O
discount O
over O
new O
. O

Excepting O
those O
where O
age O
or O
wear O
and O
tear O
make O
a O
huge O
difference O
in O
useful O
life O
vs O
cost O
. O

Or O
were O
used O
has O
little O
cost O
benefit O
over O
new O
. O

Anything O
heavy O
duty O
and O
mechanical O
I O
definitely O
buy O
used O
. O

That O
way O
I O
can O
buy O
something O
that O
is O
top O
of O
the O
line O
and O
built O
in O
the O
USA B-GPE
or O
other O
first O
world O
nation O
. O

Rather O
than O
some O
cheap O
POS O
built O
in O
China B-GPE
. O

I O
' O
ll O
take O
my O
Kirby B-ORG
vacuum O
and O
Kitchen B-ORG
Aid I-ORG
Pro O
Series O
mixer O
over O
something O
cheap O
built O
in O
China B-GPE
. O

They O
' O
ll O
withstand O
more O
use O
and O
abuse O
plus O
have O
a O
much O
longer O
overall O
lifespan O
. O

Sure O
some O
well O
made O
stuff O
can O
come O
from O
China B-GPE
. O

When O
the O
company O
contracting O
insists O
on O
the O
factory O
to O
meet O
stringent O
quality O
standards O
. O

But O
they O
are O
usually O
more O
interested O
in O
price O
over O
quality O
. O

Jim B-PER

I O
don O

I O
must O
admit O
that O
there O
appear O
to O
be O
many O
on O

Lets O
not O

that O

with O

it O
went O
on O

have O
a O

. O

Whoa O
. O
. O
. O

I O
might O
think O
twice O
, O
as O
well O
. O
. O
. O
Well O
at O
least O
until O
they O
work O
out O
the O
kinks O
! O

When O
the O
pilots O
refuse O
to O
fly O
them O
, O
then O
you O
worry O
. O

Apparently O
some O
news O
stations O
were O
duped O
into O
displaying O
some O
rather O
crude O
if O
racist O
crew O
names O
. O

My O
wife B-PER
sent O
me O
that O
, O
I O
wasn O
' O
t O
sure O
the O
casual O
racism O
would O
be O
received O
well O
on O
BE O
so O
didn O
' O
t O
think O
too O
post O
it O
. O

I O
did O
laugh O
though O
. O

when O
you O
don O
' O
t O
say O
things O
because O
others O
might O
be O
offended O
the O
thought O
police O
have O
got O
to O
you O
. O

What O
I O
don O
' O
t O
get O
is O
why O
this O
was O
news O
, O
the O
names O
of O
the O
pilots O
sat O
in O
the O
left O
and O
right O
seat O
were O
released O
by O
Asiana B-ORG
themselves O
the O
day O
of O
the O
crash O
. O

Which O
is O
further O
proof O
( O
as O
if O
any O
were O
needed O
) O
that O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
people O
working O
in O
the O
" O
news O
" O
media O
in O
the O
US B-GPE
are O
morons O
. O
. O
. O

Exactly O
. O
. O
That O
' O
s O
why O
it O
' O
s O
funny O
, O
it O
makes O
the O
TV O
station B-ORG
and O
their O
news O

. O

look O
really O
stupid O
. O

Sorry O
, O
but O
I O
don O
' O
t O
really O
see O
what O
is O
racist O
about O
making O
up O
a O
silly O
name O
such O
as O
Sum O
Ting O
Wong O
. O
. O
it O
is O
mildly O
funny O
in O
a O
wacky O
way O
but O
the O
person B-PER
who O
read O
the O
list O
on O

without O
seeing O
what O
' O
s O
up O
is O
an O
idiot B-PER
. O

imo O
its O
playing O
on O
stereotypes O
rather O
being O
truly O

. O
. O
. O

I O
like O
what O
someone O

You O

laughed O

off O
too O
( O

however O
the O

that O

A O

How O
the O

Who O
' O

Yeah O
this O
sounds O
very O

I O
wonder O
was O
the O

for O
thanks O
for O
something O
else O

What O
integrity O
? O

Being O
found O
out O
? O

Actually O
resigned O
when O
being O
caught O
doing O
something O
wrong O
/ O
illegal O
/ O
immoral O
/ O
etc O
. O

I O
think O
wishing O
for O
a O
' O
liberal O
' O
politician O
, O
or O
indeed O
any O
politician O
, O
with O
actual O
integrity O
, O
is O
like O
wishing O
for O
a O
pot O
of O
gold O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
rainbow O
. O

Need O
to O
set O
sights O
on O
the O
credible O
. O

Surely O
if O
he O
truly O
had O
integrity O
he O
would O
a O
) O
not O
have O
lied O
to O
the O
commission O
or O
b O
) O
declared O
the O
wine O
when O
given O
it O
. O

Admittedly O
, O
he O
demonstrated O
* O
some O
* O
integrity O
by O
not O
clinging O
on O
with O
all O
20 O
fingers O
and O
toes O
until O
someone O
came O
along O
and O
stamped O
on O
them O
, O
so O
I O
' O
ll O
give O
you O
that O
. O

To O
be O
fair O
, O
he O
didn O
' O
t O
admit O
to O
being O
found O
out O
. O

He O
admitted O
to O
having O
a O
massive O
memory O
failure O
. O

It O
makes O
it O
dodgy O
as O
a O
memory O
failure O
is O
forgiveable O
. O

Yeah O
, O
but O
he O
didn O
' O
t O
claim O
the O
note O
was O
a O
forgery O
and O
have O
the O
reporters O
concerned O
arrested O
as O
part O
of O
a O
criminal O
conspiracy O
. O

I O
can O
think O
of O
a O
few O
liberal O
politicians O
who O
would O
have O
. O
. O
. O
. O

So O
in O
relative O
terms O
, O
he O
' O
s O
got O
integrity O

It O
doesn O
' O
t O
seem O
right O
that O
Barry B-PER
O I-PER
' I-PER
Farrell I-PER
should O
resign O
over O
this O
when O
you O
consider O
what O
happened O
in O
NSW B-GPE
, O
for O
20 O
years O
, O
under O
a O
Labour B-ORG
government B-ORG
. O

Nothing O
ever O
got O
to O
ICAC B-ORG

The O
funny O
thing O
was O
that O
after O
each O
election O
you O
could O
never O
find O
anyone O
who O
would O
admit O
to O

Unless O
this O
move O
is O
part O
of O
a O
massive O
cover O
up O
which O
he O
wants O
to O
deflect O
attention O

Choe B-PER
visited O
an O
industrial O
park B-FAC
in O
Beijing B-GPE
on O
Thursday O
. O

China B-GPE
’ O
s O
basic O
advice O
to O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
is O
reform O
of O
its O
economy O
should O
follow O
the O
path O
of O
Deng B-PER
Xiaoping I-PER
with O
special O
economic O
zones O

some O
private O
enterprise O
. O

Choe B-PER
’ O

visit O
is O
being O
watched O
closely O
by O
North B-GPE
Korean I-GPE
experts O
in O
China B-GPE
. O

They O
say O
they O
detect O
little O
change O
in O
China B-GPE
’ O
s O
underlying O
policy O
of O
supporting O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
. O

But O
the O
Chinese B-GPE
leadership O
would O
like O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
to O
modify O
its O
erratic O
behavior O
, O
stop O
nuclear O
tests O
and O
halt O
its O

they O

How O
to O
reach O
that O
goal O
with O
Kim B-PER
had O
not O
been O
resolved O
, O
some O
of O
the O
experts O
said O
. O

China B-GPE
should O
begin O
to O
treat O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
as O
a O
normal O
country O
and O
should O
resist O
extremes O
of O
sheltering O
it O

the O

Fired O

So O
it O
looks O
like O
Leo B-PER
' O
s O
ego O
got O
in O
the O
way O
again O
as O
he O
fired O
Tom B-PER
today O
. O

i O
broke O
up O
with O
my O
girlfriend B-PER
of O
2 O
years O
, O
she O
admitted O
to O
having O
feelings O
for O
someone B-PER
else O
. O

the O
pain O
! O

Nooooooo O
! O

Tom B-PER
was O
the O
only O
reason O
why O
I O
even O
tuned O
into O
TWiT O
! O

More O
from O
Leo B-PER
. O

He O
wants O
a O
full O
time O
in O
house B-ORG
news O
director O
. O

And O
has O
hired O
Mike B-PER
Elgan I-PER
. O

Mike B-PER
Elgan I-PER
? O

Seriously O
? O

It O
sounds O
like O
that O
the O
Tom B-PER
not O
working O
in O
the O
same O
studio B-FAC
was O
hampering O
the O
production O
of O
the O
show O
. O

Skype O
can O
only O
go O
so O
far O
, O
at O
least O
it O
seems O
for O
this O
situation O
. O

I O
can O
' O
t O
say O
this O
is O
a O
good O
or O
bad O
move O
until O
things O
shake O
out O
a O
bit O
more O
. O

Tom B-PER
Merritt I-PER
- O
Understands O
tech O
and O
genuinely O
loves O
talking O
about O
it O
. O

Sarah B-PER
Lane I-PER
- O
Boring O
, O
distracted O
, O
Nearly O
clueless O
about O
tech O
and O
seems O
to O
only O
work O
at O
TWiT B-ORG
to O
fund O
her O
globetrotting O
vacations O

I O
' O
m O
sad O
that O
Tom B-PER
was O
let O
go O
but O
I O
understand O
why O
they O
had O
to O
do O
it O
. O

But O
what O
has O
always O
been O
a O
puzzle O
is O
why O
they O
continue O
to O
keep O
Sarah B-PER
Lane I-PER
on O
board O
. O

I O
' O
m O
sure O
she O
' O
s O
a O
nice O
girl O
( O
well O
, O
not O
really O
because O
she O
seems O
pretty O
condescending O
) O
but O
for O
a O
Tech O
commentator B-PER
then O
she O
just O
seems O
so O
disinterested O
in O
everything O
tech O
. O

It O
doesn O
' O
t O
sound O
like O
Tom B-PER
was O
fired O
per O
se O
, O
but O
that O
his O
contract O
wasn O
' O
t O
renewed O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
his O
distance O
and O
therefore O
lack O
of O
presence O
in O
the O
studio B-FAC
had O
more O
to O
do O
with O
it O
than O
Leo B-PER
' O
s O
ego O
. O

This O
of O
course O
is O
based O
on O
what O
Leo B-PER
wrote O
in O
those O
two O
blog O
posts O
. O

Call O
it O
what O
you O
will O
, O
but O
I O
don O
' O
t O
view O
it O
as O
he O
' O
s O
be O
' O
fired O
' O
as O
in O
let O
go O
because O
of O
wrong O
- O
doing O
. O

Unless O
Tom B-PER
speaks O
out O
and O
gives O
a O
different O
story O
, O
that O
' O
s O
what O
I O
choose O
to O
believe O
. O

As O
for O
Mike B-PER
joining O
the O
team B-ORG
I O
' O
m O
sure O
he O
' O
ll O
do O
a O
good O
job O
. O

I O
' O
m O
not O
a O
huge O
fan O
of O
his O
, O
but O
I O
don O
' O
t O
dislike O
him O
either O
. O

Sarah B-PER
is O
fine O
host O
IMO O
, O
but O
I O
only O
watch O
her O
on O
iPad O
Today O
and O
no O
other O
shows O
. O

Leo B-PER
said O
he O
wants O
a O
real O
news O
division O
. O

So O
far O
all O
they O
do O
is O
read O
stories O
off O
the O
web O
. O

Elgan B-PER
is O
supposedly O
a O
great O
journalist O
so O
will O
they O
do O
more O
in O
house B-ORG
reporting O
and O
investigative O
stories O
now O
? O

I O
agree O
that O
Sarah B-PER
is O
dead O
weight O
there B-ORG
, O
she O
would O
make O
a O
decent O
host O
but O
has O
no O
business O
reporting O
on O
tech O
. O

To O
me O
it O
sounds O
more O
like O
he O
let O
him O
go O
, O
since O
he O
wasn O
' O
t O
in O
house B-ORG
and O
wasn O
' O
t O
local O
. O

The O
Skype O
thing O
was O
only O
going O
so O
far O
. O

Doesn O
' O
t O
sound O
like O
a O
firing O
to O
me O
at O
all O
. O

Though O
I O
think O
she O
does O
prep O
for O
her O
shows O
I O
would O
agree O
that O
she O
is O
not O
Twit B-ORG

It O
just O
sounds O

they O
want O
someone O
a O
bit O
more O
full O
time O
I O
am O
sure O
Tom B-PER
will O
do O
well O
. O

I O
think O
Tom B-PER
wanted O
out O
long O
ago O
, O
he O
saw O
the O
direction O
TWiT B-ORG
was O
going O
in O
and O
how O
he O
could O
be O
more O
successful O
elsewhere O

Leo B-PER
really O
is O
tanking O
his O

to O
make O

Jobs B-PER
relates O
stories O
about O
his O
life O
, O
including O
his O

at O

Jobs B-PER

Apple B-ORG
when O
Apple B-ORG
purchased O
NeXT B-ORG
( O
also O
founded O

. O

Wow O

I O
didn O
' O
t O
realize O
Job B-PER
was O
doing O
this O
- O
would O
have O
been O
a O
great O
speech O
to O
hear O
and O
experience O
. O

We O
didn O
' O

It O
is O
nice O
to O
see O
Jobs B-PER
beign O
so O
involved O
with O
higher O
eductaion O
. O

He O
sure O
made O
getting O
fired O
sound O
as O
not O
a O
bad O
thing O
. O

Think O
Different O

Compared O
to O
GWs B-PER
speech O
about O
being O
a O
' O
C O
' O
student O

and O
becoming O
President O
- O
- O
this O
somewhat O
outdoes O

that O
Lame O
Yale B-ORG
address O
, O
and O
proves O
a O
drop O
out O
can O

become O
a O
true O
leader O
who O
truly O
empowers O

individuals O
and O
changes O
lives O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O

That O
part O
about O
the O
pancreas O
cancer O
and O
the O
doctor B-PER
telling O
him O
he O
only O
had O
3 O
- O
6 O
months O
to O
live O
, O
then O
finding O
out O
it O
was O
actually O
a O
curable O
cancer O
was O
really O
something O
to O
read O
. O

Wow O
Steve B-PER

amazing O
, O
I O
really O
wish O
I O
could O
have O
been O
there B-LOC
for O
it O
but O
then O
again O
i O
dont O
go O
to O
Stanford B-ORG
. O

Just O
finished O
reading O
it O
. O

Next O
year O
is O
my O
senior O
year O
at O
college B-ORG
, O
man O
it O
would O
be O
sweet O
to O
have O
him O
come O
and O
talk O
at O
my O
school B-ORG
( O
I O
highly O
doubt O
it O
though O
, O
I O
go O

the O
University B-ORG
of I-ORG
Vermont I-ORG
, O
I O
don O
' O

As O

this O

blasphemy O

Steve B-PER

this O
is O
unforgivable O
! O

Video O
clip O
: O

And O
Steve B-PER
' O
s O
return O
to O
Apple B-ORG
was O
the O
best O
thing O
that O
ever O
happened O
to O
the O
company B-ORG
. O

Very O
strange O
to O
stand O
up O
before O
a O
graduating O
class O
and O
say O
one O
of O
the O
best O
decisions O
he O
ever O
made O
was O
dropping O
out O
of O
college B-ORG
lol O

Thank O
you O
for O
that O
. O

Watching O
it O
was O
all O
the O
more O
inspirational O
. O

I O
like O
this O
quote O
. O
. O
. O

Remembering O
that O
you O
are O
going O
to O
die O
is O
the O
best O
way O
I O
know O
to O
avoid O
the O
trap O
of O
thinking O
you O
have O
something O
to O
lose O
. O

don O
' O
t O
be O
such O
a O
Weeny B-PER

you O
can O
always O
start O
using O
windows O
. O
. O
. O

Damn O
good O
speech O
Steve B-PER
. O

Keep O
fighting O
the O
good O
fight O
. O

makes O
me O
wanna O
go O
to O
work O
. O
. O
. O

After O
watching O
the O
video O
, O
it O
' O
s O
strange O
to O
see O
Steve B-PER
reading O
because O
at O
the O
Keynotes O
he O
is O
so O
smooth O
and O
passionate O
, O
this O
felt O
very O
rigid O
. O

I O
still O
don O
' O
t O
get O
how O
he O
could O
be O
fired O
from O
a O
company B-ORG
he O
started O
. O
. O
. O
. O

That O
' O
s O
happened O
to O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
, O
actually O
. O

It O
' O
s O
not O
as O
strange O
as O
it O
initially O
seems O
. O

After O
seeing O
the O
clip O
, O
that O
was O
my O
first O
thought O
too O
. O

I O
assumed O
before O
I O
saw O
the O
speech O
that O
Steve B-PER
had O
memorized O
it O
. O

The O
speech O
was O
very O
inspirational O
though O
. O

He O
really O
delivered O
for O
Stanford B-ORG
. O

Enjoyed O
reading O
his O
speech O
. O

Steve B-PER
makes O
some O
very O
good O
life O
points O
. O

Connecting O
the O
dots O
. O
. O
. O

When O
he O
came O
back O
to O
Apple B-ORG
, O
he O
was O
hired O
for O
$ O
1 O
per O
year O
. O

That O
was O
it O
. O

Until O
the O
BOD B-ORG
gave O
him O
the O
airplane O
and O
then O
other O
items O
. O

He O
was O
following O
his O
passion O
the O
gravy O
followed O
. O

nice O

it O
really O
touched O
my O

Everything O

meaningless O
compared O
to O

Wow O

some O
of O

there O

, O
up O
from O

, O

in O
2002 O
. O

The O
decade O
long O
surge O
in O
gun O
sales O
was O
driven O
partially O
by O
a O
widespread O
fear O
of O
more O
gun O

, O
some O
analysts O
said O
. O

The O
UCLA B-ORG

said O
that O
10 O
years O

, O
roughly O
5 O
million O
Californians B-GPE
, O
or O
20 O

that O

to O

the O

Some O

say O
that O
more O
important O
than O
the O
increase O
in O

is O
who O

I O
do O
agree O

that O

would O
be O
a O
better O

This O

If O
you O
think O
about O
the O

rather O
assuming O
the O

the O

( O
btw O
, O
there O
' O
s O
no O
such O
thing O
as O
reverse O
racism O

It O
' O
s O
just O
racism O
) O

Its O
because O
in O
the O
US B-GPE
black O
lives O
don O
’ O
t O
matter O
and O
have O
never O
mattered O
. O

They O
' O
ve O
been O
and O
continue O
to O
be O
, O
a O
brutalized O
, O
subjugated O
and O
tortured O
people O
. O

Historically O
white O
lives O
have O
mattered O
whereas O
black O
ones O
haven O
' O
t O
. O

To O
even O
suggest O
that O
the O
two O
( O
white O
and O
black O
lives O
in O
the O
US B-GPE
) O
are O
comparable O
shows O
at O
best O
a O
scant O
understanding O
of O
the O

Lets O
make O

we O
keep O

Fair O

I O
' O
m O
not O
racist O
some O
of O
my O
best O

This O
actually O
makes O
sense O
, O
I O
presumed O
it O
' O
s O
more O
a O
response O
to O
the O
US B-GPE

So O
why O
did O

out O

agree O
that O

had O
issues O
. O

Is O
it O
getting O
that O
bad O
here B-GPE
too O

Surely O
the O
problem O
is O
that O
visual O

do O
matter O
tremendously O
as O
they O
serve O
a O

his O

He O
' O

far O
from O

Bitcoins O
are O
virtual O
money O
that O
has O
no O
intrinsic O
value O
but O
is O
currently O
trading O
for O
about O
$ O
630 O
each O
. O

Initially O
someone O
created O
a O
software O
concept O
that O
would O
produce O
Bitcoins O
quickly O
but O
as O
time O
passed O
, O
it O
became O
more O
difficult O
to O
create O
them O
. O

After O
about O
8 O
million O
Bitcoins O
were O
produced O
, O
even O
groups O
of O
people O
with O
computers O
couldn O
' O
t O
produce O
Bitcoins O
without O
using O
more O
electricity O
than O
the O
current O
trading O
value O
of O
a O
Bitcoin O
and O
then O
companies O
produced O
special O
hardware O
that O
was O
designed O
for O
the O
sole O
purpose O
of O
producing O
Bitcoins O
. O

When O
20 O
million O
Bitcoins O
are O
eventually O
produced O
, O
no O
more O
Bitcoins O
can O
be O
produced O
. O

Bitcoins O
are O
held O
in O
a O
blockchain O
and O
are O
validated O
by O
groups O
of O
miners O
( O
people O
that O
are O
producing O
Bitcoins O
) O
. O

Therefore O
it O
needs O
Bitcoin O
miner O
software O
running O
around O
the O
world B-LOC
to O
validate O
trades O
. O

Although O
some O

take O
Bitcoins O
and O
instantly O
use O
an O

to O
trade O
it O
into O
the O
local O

( O
customer O
usually O
doesn O
' O
t O
know O
the O

rate O
until O
it O

) O
, O
most O
of O
the O

is O
for O

If O
you O
look O
at O

- O
$ O

you O
have O
to O
be O
very O
careful O
who O
you O
are O
dealing O
with O

Michael B-PER
' O

explanation O
is O
correct O

in O
short O

It O
is O
essentially O
a O
very O
complex O
confidence O

So O
long O
as O
everyone O
who O
uses O
and O
holds O
Bitcoins O
acts O
as O
if O
they O
continue O
to O
believe O
that O
Bitcoins O
have O
value O
then O
everything O
will O
continue O
, O
but O
as O
soon O
as O
there O
is O
a O
whiff O
that O
" O
the O
game O
is O
over O

, O
they O
will O
sink O

very O
very O
quickly O

There O

Does O
anyone O

In O
that O
, O
Robespierre B-PER
essentially O
became O

Steve B-PER

the O

id O
rather O
see O
if O
anyone O

something O
before O

cheers O

Now O
that O
you O
mention O
it O
- O
yeah O
, O
it O
does O
sorta O
seem O
that O
way O
, O
doesn O
' O
t O
it O
. O

Umm O
, O
the O
French B-GPE
Revolution O
was O
an O
ideological O
movement O
, O
in O
which O
Robespierre B-PER
went O
overboard O
and O
enforced O
it O
violently O
. O

Apple B-ORG
Computer I-ORG
is O
a O
company B-ORG
that O
was O
co O
- O
founded O
by O
Steve B-PER
Jobs I-PER
, O
kicked O
Jobs B-PER
out O
, O
and O
then O
got O
him O
back O
as O
CEO O

How O
are O
they O
related O
at O
all O
? O

I O
honestly O
can O
' O
t O
think O
of O
anyway O
in O
which O
they O
' O
re O
related O
, O
even O
distantly O
. O

And O
by O
the O
way O
, O
I O
' O
m O
a O
history O
major B-PER
. O

lol O
oh O
no O
the O
history O
major B-PER
has O
spoken O
. O

i O
enjoyed O
the O
brief O
recap O
you O
gave O
about O
the O
revolution O
and O
apple B-ORG
' O
s O
history O
but O
that O
wasnt O
what O
i O
was O
going O
for O
. O

im O
strictly O
talking O
about O
the O
two O
men O
themselves O
. O

As O
the O
french B-GPE
revolution O
proceeded O
, O
Robespierre B-PER
came O
to O
associate O
himself O
more O
and O
more O
with O
the O
essence O
of O
the O
conflict O
at O
hand O
. O

In O
the O
revolutions O
worst O
years O
, O
Robespierre B-PER
was O
often O
noted O
to O
speak O
of O
an O
illness O
he O
acquired O
, O
he O
said O
that O
his O
life O
was O
not O
interwoven O
with O
the O
revolution O
. O

through O
the O
massacres O
and O
even O
the O
terror O
, O
Robespierre B-PER
defended O
these O
acts O
b O
/ O
c O
he O
was O
convinced O
that O
they O
were O
needed O
for O
the O
revolution O
to O
really O
come O
to O
fruition O
. O

i O
believe O
Robespierre B-PER
compromised O
himself O
to O
become O
this O
greater O
cause O
, O
and O
went O
to O
extreme O
lengths O
to O
excuse O
the O
revolution O
and O
allow O
it O
to O
proceed O
uncontrolled O
. O

extreme O
? O

yes O
. O

but O
i O
feel O
robespierre B-PER
really O
did O
come O
to O
represent O
the O
cause O
and O
errors O
that O
were O
the O
revolution O

now O
i O
say O
robespierre B-PER
and O
jobs B-PER
are O
alike O
b O
/ O
c O
jobs B-PER
seems O
to O
be O
apples B-ORG
own O
" O
personal O
representative B-PER
" O
. O

Like O
robespierre B-PER
, O
jobs B-PER
is O
known O
for O
being O
difficult O
to O
work O
for O
. O

strictly O
b O
/ O
c O
jobs B-PER
refused O
to O
compromise O
the O
goal O
of O
apple B-ORG
in O
any O
way O
, O
and O
robespierre B-PER
did O
the O
same O
by O
excuses O
the O
murders O
. O

the O
two O
characters O
persist O
in O
thier O
cause O
and O
like O
wise O
meet O
opposition O
from O
within O
thier O
own O
cabinet O
. O

thats O
some O
of O
what O
i O
think O

oh O
and O
btw O
im O
a O
history O
major B-PER
two O
, O
well O
double O
major B-PER
with O
biochem O
. O
cheers O

Yeah O
. O
. O
. O
I O
' O
m O
no O
history O
major O

but O
I O
am O
a O
student B-PER

European B-LOC
History O

. O
. O

. O
. O
. O
Robespierre B-PER
= O
bad O
. O

You O
think O
the O
French B-GPE
would O
invite O
Robespierre B-PER
back O
after O
he O
was O
gone O
5 O
years O
? O

No O
. O

I O
hope O
Jobs B-PER
isn O
' O
t O
guillotined O
! O
! O
! O

I O
still O
don O
' O
t O
think O
that O
the O
two O
are O
that O
similar O
, O
although O
I O
do O
see O
what O
you O
' O
re O
saying O
now O
. O

Robespierre B-PER
became O
the O
French B-GPE
Revolution O
, O
whereas O
I O
think O
it O
' O
s O
more O
that O
Apple B-ORG
Computers I-ORG
became O
Steve B-PER
Jobs I-PER
. O

Robespierre B-PER
wouldn O
' O
t O
do O
anything O
to O
compromise O
the O
Revolution O
, O
whereas O
Jobs B-PER
has O
to O
do O
everything O
his O
way O
. O

The O
Revolution O
was O
an O
ideology O
, O
so O
one O
could O
subscribe O
oneself O
to O
its O
inerrancy O
. O

Apple B-ORG
Computers I-ORG
is O
a O
company B-ORG
and O
has O
no O
ideology O
. O

Jobs B-PER
cannot O
believe O
that O
Apple B-ORG
Computers I-ORG
is O
inerrant O
because O
Apple B-ORG
Computers I-ORG
is O
whatever O
he O
makes O
of O
it O
. O

Instead O
, O
Jobs B-PER
, O
if O
he O
believes O
in O
the O
inerrancy O
of O
anything O
, O
believes O
in O
the O
inerrancy O
of O
himself O
. O

EDIT O
: O
You O
know O
, O
I O
probably O
should O
mention O
that O
I O
haven O
' O
t O
done O
French B-GPE
history O
since O
high O
school B-ORG
, O
so O
. O
. O
. O

If O
you O
have O
any O
comparisons O
of O
Apple B-ORG
Computers I-ORG
to O
, O
say O
, O
Eastern B-LOC
Europe I-LOC
between O
500 O
and O
1800 O
or O
the O
Byzantine B-GPE
Empire I-GPE
, O
I O
' O
d O
be O
much O
better O
at O
responding O
. O

i O
think O
he O
was O
somewhat O
necessary O
in O
the O
early O
stages O
of O
the O
revolution O
but O
its O
just O
so O
disapointing O
how O
he O
didnt O
use O
his O
power O
as O
he O
should O
. O

not O
that O
he O
played O
the O
dictator O
( O
altho O
there O
is O
a O
clique O
of O
historians O
who O
do O
believe O
so O
) O
but O
that O
he O
didnt O
stop O
the O
atrocities O
around O
him O
. O

I O
get O
what O
you O
mean O
, O
but O
I O
don O
' O
t O
think O
it O
' O
s O
the O
best O
analogy O
. O

First O
Jobs B-PER
has O
to O
massacre O
thousands O
of O
people O
? O
? O

Yeah O
, O
see O
the O
difference O
? O

But O
I O
do O
get O
it O
' O
s O
basis O
. O
. O
. O
not O
a O
bad O
thought O
, O
in O
the O
regard O
you O

for O
the O

the O
21st O

Pennsylvania B-GPE

Actually O
I O
am O
very O
surprised O
that O
the O
decisions O
have O
been O
overturned O
quickly O
without O
much O
of O
a O
struggle O
from O
the O
right O
. O

With O
the O
religious O
right O
in O
control O
of O
the O
republican B-ORG
party I-ORG
, O
I O
suspected O
much O
greater O
resistance O
with O
rioting O
in O
the O
streets O
but O
opposition O
has O
been O
more O
like O
a O
whimper O
than O
a O
bang O
. O

However O
in O
liberal O
France B-GPE
, O
riots O
have O
occurred O
putting O
fear O
into O
the O
government B-ORG
about O
making O
gay O
marriage O
legal O
. O

In O
France B-GPE
I O
guess O
it O
' O
s O
ok O
to O
have O
a O
mistress O
but O
not O
ok O
to O
be O
gay O
. O

Is O
it O
possible O
the O
right O
have O
quietly O
decided O
to O
give O
up O
on O
the O
defence O
of O
marriage O
and O
anti O

issues O
? O

Maybe O
the O

they O
are O

They O
are O

fighting O
Obamacare B-PER
as O
the O

of O
the O

and O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
more O
votes O
they O
could O
pick O
up O
from O
the O

and O
left O
if O
they O

Obamacare B-PER

I O
don O
' O

know O

In O
a O
couple O
of O
places O
at O

the O
judge O
has O
been O
very O
strict O
on O
who O
has O
standing O
to O
defend O
the O

much O
to O
the O
dismay O
of O

the O

how O
can O
they O
in O
all O
conscience O
defend O
it O
. O

It O
' O

not O
that O
" O
likely O
to O
cause O
a O
riot O
in O
France B-GPE
" O
is O
a O
particularly O
high O
bar O
though O

We O
were O
on O

the O

that O
had O
broken O
out O
across O
the O
country B-GPE
the O
night O
before O
when O
the O
results O
came O
in O
. O

This O
doesn O
' O
t O
surprise O
me O
. O

" O
Liberal O
France B-GPE
" O
is O
Roman O
Catholic O
. O

So O
yes O
, O
a O
mistress O
is O
fine O
, O
being O
gay O
is O
not O
. O
. O
. O
yet O
. O

Explain O
something O
to O
me O
- O
how O
can O
a O
Federal O
judge O
overturn O
a O
state O
ban O
? O

Or O
have O
I O
been O
reading O
shoddy O
reporting O
? O

The O
federal O
courts O
are O
empowered O
to O
rule O
on O
anything O
pertaining O
to O
the O
US B-GPE
constitution O
. O

There O
is O
a O
system O
in O
place O
for O
rulings O
and O
appeals O
until O
the O
issue O
is O
brought O
before O
the O
supreme B-ORG
court I-ORG
. O

If O
the O
supreme B-ORG
court I-ORG
elects O
to O
hear O
the O
case O
, O
then O
their O
ruling O
will O
be O
final O
. O

If O
they O
don O
' O
t O
elect O
to O
hear O
the O
case O
, O
the O
last O
ruling O
is O
final O
. O

Since O
DOMA O
was O
struck O
down O
by O
the O
supreme B-ORG
court I-ORG
, O
many O
of O
the O
state O
bans O
may O
be O
in O
conflict O
with O
DOMA O
. O

Therefore O
when O
someone O
appeals O
to O
a O
federal O
judge O
, O
that O
judge O
' O
s O
ruling O
( O
in O
his O
/ O
her O
opinion O
) O
is O
just O
a O
reflection O
of O
the O
ruling O
made O
by O
the O
supreme B-ORG
court I-ORG
. O

However O
the O
attorney O
general O
of O
the O
state O
can O
appeal O
that O
decision O
but O
often O
the O
decision O
is O
left O
in O
place O
before O
it O
gets O
to O
the O
supreme B-ORG
court I-ORG
and O
the O
supreme B-ORG
court I-ORG
refuses O
to O
hear O
that O
appeal O
. O

The O
courts O
have O
the O
authority O
to O
rule O
on O
the O
constitutionality O
of O
any O
legislation O
and O
are O
invoking O
the O
14th O
Amendment O
, O
equal O
protection O
under O
the O
law O
. O

They O
can O
appeal O
but O
they O
' O
re O
not O
, O
probably O
because O
it O
' O
s O
an O
election O

and O
they O
figure O
it O

To O
Retire O

Now O
that O
I O
' O
ve O
got O
your O
attention O

. O

He O
' O
s O
currently O
50 O

how O
long O
do O
you O
want O
to O
spend O
making O
sure O
more O

go O
onto O
a O

? O

I O
believe O
that O
the O
move O
to O
Intel B-ORG
is O
a O
sign O
that O
retirement O
is O
impending O
, O
guessing O
within O
the O

5 O
years O

Moving O
to O
Intel B-ORG
was O
a O
bold O
move O
in O
anyones O
book O
, O
and O
probably O
the O
best O
chance O
Apple B-ORG
has O
to O
become O
the O
world B-LOC
' O
s O
biggest O
computer O
company O
. O

After O
all O
as O
Steve B-PER
Jobs I-PER
said O
himself O
, O
it O
' O
s O
about O
the O
software O
, O
and O
who O
gives O
a O
better O
software O
experience O
then O
Apple B-ORG
? O

And O
what O
better O
note O
to O
retire O
on O
? O

Call O
it O
the O
final O
stand O
, O
swansong O
, O
whatever O
. O

Which O
is O
why O
I O
think O
the O
switch O
to O
Intel B-ORG
has O
a O
little O
more O
to O
do O
with O
Steve B-PER
Jobs I-PER
himself O
than O
IBM B-ORG
' O

roadmap O
. O

Maybe O
but O
I O
don O
' O
t O
think O
the O
Intel B-ORG
switch O
has O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
it O
. O

Steve B-PER
' O
s O
a O
pretty O
unique O
CEO B-PER
so O
it O
' O
s O
pretty O
difficult O
to O
say O
how O
far O
he O
' O
ll O
go O
age O
- O
wise O
but O
I O
' O
m O
guessing O
he O
' O
ll O
still O
have O
a O
presence O
at O
60 O
. O

If O
only O
to O
see O
a O
pay O
rise O
from O
his O
single O
dollar O
income O
. O

50 O
is O
pretty O
young O
to O
retire O
. O

50 O
is O
pretty O
young O
to O
even O
be O
a O
CEO O
. O

I O
doubt O
it O
will O
happen O
in O
10 O
years O
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
think O
his O
ego O
will O
allow O
him O
to O
retire O
. O

He O
enjoys O
what O
he O
does O
too O
much O
and O
has O
said O
so O
. O

He O
' O
s O
not O
interested O
in O
retiring O
, O
as O
he O
has O
too O
many O
things O
he O
still O
wants O
to O
accomplish O
. O

In O
other O
words O
: O
No O
. O

Time O
. O

Soon O
. O

his O
chances O
of O
retiring O
are O
the O
same O
as O
the O
chances O
of O
theo B-PER
epstein I-PER
retiring O

This O
sounds O
sorta O
like O
Netcraft B-ORG
confirming O
that O
Apple B-ORG

dying O
for O
the O
last O
20 O
years O
. O

Apple B-ORG
isn O
' O
t O
about O
money O
for O
Steve B-PER
its O
about O
ego O
, O
I O
doubt O
he O
will O
retire O
before O
65 O
. O

While O
he O
could O
step O
back O
a O
little O
at O
some O
time O
in O
the O
next O
couple O
decades O
, O
like O
stop O
doing O
the O
keynotes O
, O
barring O
a O
major O
health O
issue O
, O
I O
can O
' O
t O
see O
him O
retiring O
either O
. O

If O
there O
was O
some O
new O
challenge O
for O
him O
I O
could O
see O
him O
jumping O
ship O
and O
taking O
on O
a O
new O
company O
, O
but O
just O
retiring O
bacause O
he O
' O
s O
old O
? O

Not O
a O
chance O
. O

He O
' O
s O
not O
. O

I O
doubt O
he O
would O
voluntarily O
retire O
before O
75 O

im O
only O
19 O

AND O
i O
earn O
significantly O
less O

try O
nothing O

but O
seriously O

i O
doubt O

will O
retire O
for O
a O
while O
yet O
. O

he O
' O

hoisted O
Apple B-ORG
up O
and O
i O
doubt O
they O
' O
d O
let O
him O
go O
quietly O
. O

He O
' O

got O
it O
pretty O
easy O
, O
I O
' O
d O

even O
with O
the O

My O
money O
' O

on O
the O
65 O

if O

it O

Facing O
a O
$ O
192 O
million O
shortfall O
because O
of O
sequestration O
, O
NOAA B-ORG
has O
proposed O
furloughing O
each O
of O
its O
roughly O
12 O
, O
000 O
employees O
for O
four O
days O
this O
summer O
, O
said O
spokeswoman O
Ciaran B-PER
Clayton I-PER

The O
plan O
calls O
for O

worker O
to O
take O
two O
furlough O
days O
in O
July O

August O
, O
starting O

Though O
Clayton B-PER

the O
furloughs O
would O
be O
difficult O
, O
she O
said O
NOAA B-ORG

little O
time O
to O
manage O
the O
shortfall O
before O
the O
end O
of O
the O

, O
Clayton B-PER
said O
, O
NOAA B-ORG
would O
consider O
canceling O
the O

But O
such O
a O
cancellation O
would O
work O
only O

the O

He O
said O
employees O

The O

Hi O
everyone O
, O

Thank O
you O
for O
your O
comments O
. O

I O
have O
been O
looking O
on O
the O
internet O
at O
furniture O
and O
saw O
that O
you O
can O
get O
house O
packages O
from O
Super B-ORG
Amart I-ORG
. O

From O
what O
I O
have O
seen O
, O
if O
we O
go O
with O
the O
top O
range O
of O
furniture O
from O
there B-ORG
, O
we O
could O
furnish O
most O
of O
the O
house B-FAC
for O
the O
price O
of O
a O
container O
. O

But O
from O
your O
comments O
am O
I O
missing O
something O

Lisa B-PER
x I-PER
. O

Well O
you O
would O
get O
the O
most O
basic O
furniture O
, O
probably O
not O
all O
what O
you O
need O
, O
questionable O
quality O
( O
maybe O
I O
don O
' O
t O
know O
) O
, O
but O
in O
any O
case O
the O
bare O
bones O
of O
any O
household O
? O

No O
homely O
touches O
, O
soft O
furnishings O
? O

You O
generally O
cannot O
cramp O
all O
your O
personal O
effects O
into O
a O
suitcase O
, O
so O
you O
either O
leave O
behind O
or O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
some O
shipping O
anyway O
. O

The O
voices O
of O
experience O
generally O
say O
to O
ship O
the O
lot O
, O
but O
if O
you O
think O
something O
else O
will O
work O
for O
you O
, O
then O
no O
reason O
you O
cannot O
buck O
the O
trend O
, O

The O
internet O
tells O
me O
to O
buy O
new O
. O

The O
voices O
of O
experience O
tell O
me O
to O
ship O
the O
lot O
. O

The O
internet O
was O
winning O
last O
night O
. O

The O
voices O
are O
winning O
today O
aaarrgggg O
ha O
ha O
. O

Got O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
to O
decide O
, O
will O
let O
you O
know O
. O

Thanks O
x O
. O

There O
' O
s O
also O
the O
fact O
that O
when O
you O
are O
settling O
in O
to O
a O
new O
country O
and O
finding O
somethings O
unexpectedly O
hard O
, O
its O
nice O
to O
have O
your O
own O
stuff O
from O
' O
home O
' O
with O
you O
. O

Well O
, O
the O
reality O
is O
that O
it O
will O
take O
a O
fair O
amount O
of O
time O
for O
the O
container O
to O
arrive O
and O
in O
that O
time O
you O
will O
buy O
stuff O
unless O
in O
a O
holiday O
place O
with O
everything O
. O

We O
squatted O
for O
about O
two O
months O
with O
bare O
minimum O
until O
it O
arrived O
. O

It O
felt O
like O
Christmas O
. O

Agreed O
. O

The O
quality O
of O
furniture O
from O
Super B-ORG
Amart I-ORG
means O
you O
will O
be O
buying O
new O
all O
over O
again O
a O
year O
or O
two O
after O
you O
arrive O
. O

something O

Berlusca B-PER

M B-PER

What O
an O
amazing O
business O
. O

We O
seem O
to O
have O
an O
unholy O
combination O
of O
two O
old O
blokes O
who O
should O
have O
left O
the O
stage O
a O
long O
time O
ago O
plus O
one O
young O
bloke B-PER
whose O
only O
experience O
is O
in O
local O
government B-ORG
and O
who O
' O
s O
never O
even O
been O
elected O
to O
the O
national O
Parliament B-ORG

As O
usual O
Italian B-GPE
politics O
makes O
Eastenders O
look O
almost O
serious O

I O
' O
m O
trying O
to O
see O
the O
funny O
side O
but O
living O
here O
its O
very O
hard O
- O
I O
feel O
like O
crying O
! O
! O

It O
really O
is O
the O
most O
farcical O
situation O
ever O
and O
the O
whole O
thing O
should O
never O
have O
been O
allowed O
to O
happen O
. O

Napolitano B-PER
is O
abusing O
his O
powers O
and O
should O
retire O
from O
the O
scene O
. O

Only O
problem O
is O
that O
I O
too O
, O
fear O
that O
Berli B-PER
has O
his O
eye O
on O
the O
presidency O
. O

Then O
we O
will O
all O
have O
to O
pack O
our O
bags O
I O
think O

( O
Inciucio O
is O
the O
word O
I O
think O
- O
hear O
it O
alot O
but O
not O
sure O
of O
the O
actual O
english O
translation O
? O
) O

inciucio O
is O
mess O
or O
mess O
ups O
- O
I O
think O
. O

Berli B-PER
only O
wants O
the O
Presidency O
if O
it O
comes O
with O
more O
executive O
power O
like O
the O
US B-GPE
methinks O
. O

Napolitano B-PER
was O
struggling O
with O
old O
age O
in O
his O
last O
term O
and O
now O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O
well O
! O

I O
still O
don O
' O
t O
understand O
why O
he O
isn O
' O
t O
under O
house O
arrest O
or O
doing O
social O
work O
? O

M B-PER

Am O
am O
total O
agreement O
with O
Patty B-PER
. O

It O
' O
s O
awful O
. O

Beyond O
belief O
. O

But O
it O
' O
s O
real O
and O
it O
' O
s O
Italy B-GPE
. O

Where O
there O
is O
no O
law O
. O

A O
few O
years O
ago O
when O
there O
was O
a O
real O
prospect O
of O
Berlusconi B-PER
realising O
his O
ambition O
to O
be O
president O
I O
said O
to O
an O
Italian B-PER
of O
my O
acquaintance O
that O
the O
prospect O
was O
horrific O
. O

" O
Well O
good O
, O
it O
will O
get O
him O
out O
of O
our O
hair O
" O
( O
teachers O
) O
I O
was O
told O
. O

Yes O
a O
throwaway O
comment O
maybe O
but O
I O
' O
m O
afraid O
that O
this O
jaundiced O
Italy B-GPE
watcher B-PER
sees O
the O
place B-GPE
as O
just O
a O
load O
of O
factional O
interests O
. O

Goes O
for O
rather O
a O
lot O
on O
the O
" O
left O
" O
as O
well O
I O
fear O
. O

This O
implies O
the O
" O
bungle O
" O
" O
incompetence O
" O
view O
of O
the O
reasons O
behind O
bad O
stuff O
. O

I O
rather O
thought O
" O
inciucio O
" O
was O
at O
the O
" O
conspiracy O
" O
end O
of O
the O
range O
of O
interpretations O
and O
meant O
" O
stitch O
up O
" O
. O

( O
I O
remember O
a O
couple O
of O
ears O
ago O
seeing O
a O
very O
funny O
online O
debate O
where O
someone O
was O
claiming O
that O
" O
stitch O
- O
up O
" O
in O
English O
meant O
to O
repair O
something O
, O
to O
make O
it O
good O
. O

I O
' O
m O
pretty O
sure O
the O
person B-PER
claiming O
this O
was O
Italian B-GPE
which O
made O
it O
even O
more O
bizarre O
since O
the O
debate O
was O
about O
" O
inciucio O
" O
which O
unless O
I O
' O
m O
pretty O
much O
mistaken O
is O
used O
with O
a O
snarl O
/ O
sneer O
in O
Italy B-GPE
. O

In O
the O
end O
an O
English B-GPE
person B-PER
said O
" O
I O
give O
up O
, O
English O
is O
now O
a O
world B-LOC
language O
, O
it O
no O
longer O

long O
time O

if O
that O
' O
s O
what O
you O
say O
" O

up O
" O
means O
then O
maybe O
it O
does O
" O

I O
' O
ll O
go O
for O
stitch O
- O
up O
! O

Back O
to O
the O
original O
question O
, O
why O
haven O
' O

the O

had O
him O
put O
away O

way O

another O

What O

would O
ever O
recommend O
any O

any O

It O
always O
sound O
ridiculous O
when O
they O

those O
in O

suggesting O
they O

I O
remember O
Bertie B-PER
Ahern I-PER
, O
former O
Taosieach B-PER
of O
Ireland B-GPE
defending O
a O
pay O
rise O
saying O
he O

why O

Where O

If O
you O
no O

Get O

I O

Didn O

' O
t O
like O
him O
now O

I O
won O
' O
t O
vote O
for O
him O
next O
time O
. O

Meanwhile O
here O
in O
the O
real O
world O
we O
' O
re O
stuck O
with O
him O
. O

Not O
really O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
politics O
, O
it O
' O
s O
the O
fact O
the O
man B-PER
is O
an O
incompetent O
* O
* O
* O

wit O
who O
hasn O
' O

by O
a O
massive O

He O
' O

going O
to O

the O
next O

too O

One O
of O
the O
great O
things O
about O
1st O
world O
democracies O
is O
that O
you O
accept O
the O
elected O
government O
- O
even O
if O
you O
didn O
' O
t O
vote O
for O
them O
or O
agree O
with O
their O
policies O
. O

Just O
look O
at O
the O
socialist O
assholes O
I O
had O
governing O
me O
in O
the O
UK B-GPE
from O
1997 O
and O
here B-GPE
between O
2007 O
and O
2012 O
- O
terrible O
, O
destructive O
, O
irresponsible O
governments O
, O
but O
I O
accept O
that O
they O
were O
democratically O
elected O

It O
' O
s O
actually O
better O
than O
that O
apparently O
. O

All O
of O
the O
cronies O
with O
him O
have O
their O
pay O
set O
pro O
rata O
from O
his O
- O
so O
they O
ALL O
get O
a O
21 O
% O
pay O
rise O
. O

Combined O
with O
the O
unedifying O
performance O
of O
the O
libs O
and O
their O
stooge B-PER
at O
the O
federal O
level O
today O
and O
you O
really O
have O
to O
ask O
how O
low O
they O
can O
stoop O
. O

So O
far O
it O
seems O
there O
is O
no O
bottom O
to O
their O
talents O
. O

Your O
view O
on O
politics O
always O
seems O
to O
come O
across O
as O
a O
' O
win O
at O
all O
costs O
, O
screw O
the O
damage O
' O
attitude O
where O
the O
government O
are O
not O
at O
fault O
, O
it O
' O
s O
the O
voters O
who O
should O
shoulder O
he O
blame O
. O

It O
' O
s O
not O
very O
democratic O
if O
the O
options O
you O
base O
your O
vote O
on O
are O
just O
smokescreens O
. O

Having O
the O
option O
to O
' O
vote O
them O
out O
' O
is O
the O
biggest O
insult O
to O
citizens O
of O
a O
democratic O
society O
when O
we O
can O
' O
t O
have O
decent O

and O
where O

' O

Recall O

In O
case O
you O
haven O
' O

NJ B-GPE
is O
having O
it O
' O
s O
own O

to O
recall O
NJ B-ORG
Senate I-ORG
President O
Steve B-PER
Sweeney I-PER
. O

Sweeney B-PER
is O
from O
a O
largely O
rural O
district B-LOC
and O
has O
always O
been O
pro O
- O
sportsman O
and O
pro O
gun O
. O

Two O
years O
ago O
, O
there O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
anti O
- O
gun O
bills O
that O
were O
proposed O
in O
NJ B-GPE
' O
s O
Senate B-ORG
. O

Senate B-ORG
President O
Sweeney B-PER
promised O
that O
if O
he O
was O
elected O
, O
he O
would O
block O
every O
one O
of O
these O
bills O
from O
even O
making O
it O
to O
committee O
. O

He O
was O
elected O
and O
immediately O
combined O
all O
21 O
anti O
- O
gun O
bills O
into O
one O
big O
anti O
gun O
bill O
, O
put O
his O
name O
on O
it O
, O
and O
pushed O
it O
quickly O
through O
the O
NJ B-ORG
Senate I-ORG
. O

It O
passed O
both O
the O
NJ B-ORG
Senate I-ORG
and O
NJ B-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
but O
was O
thankfully O
vetoed O
by O
Governor O
Christie B-PER
. O

Christie B-PER
vetoed O
it O
because O
he O
' O
s O
pretending O
to O
be O
anti O
- O
gun O
so O
he O
can O
be O
president O
. O

Sweeney B-PER
pushed O
it O
through O
because O
he O
wants O
to O
be O
governor O
and O
the O
rest B-LOC
of O
NJ B-GPE
is O
anti O
- O
gun O
so O
he O
needs O
to O
be O
anti O
- O
gun O
too O

The O

This O

The O

The O

was O
booked O

wanted O

these O

Seems O
that O
Senator O

some O

that O
the O
whole O

because O

I O
' O

share O
a O
dream O
I O
had O
Monday O
night O
. O
. O
. O

Husband B-PER
and O
I O
were O
staying O
with O
friends O
in O
France B-GPE
( O
? O
) O
. O

Husband B-PER
got O
up O
in O
the O
morning O
before O
me O
, O
as O
usual O
, O
then O
came O
into O
the O
bedroom O
holding O
his O
phone O
to O
his O
ear O
and O
says O
" O
Have O
I O
done O
anything O
in O
the O
past O
year O
that O
would O
cause O
me O
to O
have O
a O
police O
record O
? O
" O

" O
Uh O
. O
. O
. O

no O
. O
. O
. O
? O
" O

Then O
he O
walked O
out O
of O
the O
room O
telling O
off O
whoever O
was O
on O
the O
phone O
. O

So O
I O
started O
to O
get O
up O
, O
and O
the O
woman O
who O
owned O
the O
house O
we O
were O
staying O
in O
comes O
in O
with O
all O
these O
forms O
, O
which O
I O
recognised O
as O
a O
bunch O
of O
IMM O
forms O
for O
immigration O
. O

She O
then O
says O
" O
So O
we O
don O
' O
t O
have O
Husband B-PER
' O
s O
police O
check O
. O
" O

" O
Uh O
, O

came O
back O
' O
no O
trace O
' O
, O
we O
applied O
back O
in O
2012 O
, O
and O
everything O
was O
fine O
. O

You O
' O
ve O
already O
issued O
him O
PR O
. O
" O

" O
No O
, O

doesn O
' O

way O
. O

We O
need O

new O
police O
certificate O
. O
" O

" O
What O
? O

No O
, O
you O
already O
gave O
him O
PR O
. O

He O
has O
his O
card O
and O
everything O
. O

He O
' O
s O
picked O
up O
everything O
and O
is O
living O
and O
working O
in O
Canada B-GPE
. O
" O

" O
That O
doesn O
' O
t O

, O
he O
needs O
a O
police O
check O
, O
or O
he O
' O
ll O
have O
his O
PR O
revoked O
. O
" O

This O
exchange O
went O
back O
and O
forth O
for O
awhile O
with O
me O
arguing O
immigration O
rules O
with O
her O
, O
and O
then O
: O

Her O
: O
" O
Let O
' O
s O
start O
over O
, O
I O
don O
' O
t O
even O
know O
your O

My O
name O
is O
Erica O

" O

Me O
: O
" O
Wait O

don O
' O
t O
even O

and O
you O
' O

me O
that O
you O
' O
re O
going O
to O
revoke O
my O
husband B-PER
' O
s O

status O
? O
" O

" O
Only O
if O
that O
woman B-PER
doesn O
' O
t O
win O
the O
election O
. O

If O
she O
loses O
then O
all O
immigrants O
will O
have O
to O
leave O
the O
country B-GPE
. O
" O

" O
. O
. O
. O
Election O
? O

You O
mean O
if O
Kathleen B-PER
Wynne I-PER
doesn O
' O
t O
win O
then O
Husband B-PER
has O
to O
leave O
? O
" O

" O
Yes O
. O
" O

And O
then O
I O
woke O
up O
. O

[ O
For O
those O
not O
in O
Ontario B-GPE
, O
there O
' O
s O
a O
provincial O
election O
next O

, O
quite O
hotly O
contested O
at O
the O
moment O
. O

Not O
sure O
who O
will O
win O
it O
. O

Wynne B-PER
is O
the O
current O
leader O
who O
is O
fighting O
to O
remain O
in O
power O
. O
] O

So O
yeah O
, O
that O
was O
my O
twisted O
and O
very O
strange O
dream O
about O
immigration O
. O

It O
was O
only O
a O
matter O
of O
time O
. O

First O
, O
Moderator B-PER

managed O
to O
stay O

even O
in O

land O

Other O

. O

You O
only O
get O
asked O
to O
be O
a O
Moderator O
or O
Concierge O
if O
you O
are O
in O
the O
full O
throes O
of O
lunacy O
. O

Otherwise O
Sue B-PER
knows O
there O
' O
s O
no O
way O
you O
' O
d O
say O
yes O
. O

Haha O

When O
I O
told O
my O
husband B-PER
about O
this O
dream O
, O
he O
just O
went O
" O
. O
. O
. O
You O
spend O
way O
too O
much O
time O
on O
BE O
. O
" O

And O
walked O
away O
. O

Hahahaha O
. O

So O
as O
a O
super O
mod B-PER
, O
that O
makes O
you O
. O
. O
. O

ready O
to O
be O

@ O
SchnookoLoly B-PER

Ha O
. O

I O
thought O
that O
was O
going O
to O
be O
a O
" O
bureaucracy O
" O
dream O
until O
you O
got O
to O
the O
election O
part O
and O
I O
was O
going O
to O
ask O
if O
you O
had O
been O
a O
civil O
servant O
. O

It O
reminded O
me O
of O
a O
recurring O
dream O
I O
used O
to O
have O
where O
someone O
in O
the O
education O
dept B-ORG
discovered O
I O
left O
school B-ORG
too O
early O
and O
even O
though O
I O
was O
an O
adult O
and O
been O
employed O
for O
many O
years O
- O
the O
last O
time O
I O
had O
this O
dream O
I O
was O
about O
40 O
- O
I O
had O
to O
return O
to O
school B-ORG
to O
complete O
the O
last O
few O
months O
. O

Having O
been O
a O
30 O
year O
civil O
servant B-PER
I O
put O
it O
down O
to O
bureaucratic O
nonsense O
. O

So O
I O
thought O
you O
were O
going O
on O
similar O
lines O
because O
of O
something O
missed O
. O

Except O
in O
CIC B-ORG
' O
s O
case O
it O
may O
well O
be O
the O
sort O
of O
thing O
they O
' O
d O
do O
, O
if O
my O
past O
experience O
with O
them O
is O
anything O
to O
go O
by O
. O

I O
once O
dreamt O
I O
had O
banned O
Sue B-PER
, O
when O
I O
woke O
up O
I O
was O
out O
of O

with O
the O
speed O

to O
check O
it O
had O
been O

a O

The O
captain B-PER
, O
Lee B-PER
Kang I-PER
Kuk I-PER
, O
who O
was O
flying O
the O

, O
told O

that O
any O
of O
the O
three O
pilots O
could O
have O
decided O
to O
break O
off O
the O
approach O
, O
but O
for O
“ O
the O

“ O
it O

a O

that O
he O

among O

that O
would O
be O
impolite O

The O

there O
was O

how O
the O

just O
35 O

in O
an O

that O
of O
the O
Airbus O
A320 O

with O
which O
he O
had O

Friday O

Fukuda B-PER
told O
a O
press O
conference O
that O
there O
was O
currently O
no O
emergency O
or O
pandemic O
, O
but O
many O
things O
about O
the O
disease O
remained O
unknown O
such O
as O
the O
animal O
reservoir O
. O

" O
I O
do O
want O
to O
stress O
that O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
that O
we O
do O
not O
know O
. O

For O
example O
, O
one O
of O
the O
key O
pieces O
of O
missing O
information O
is O
that O
are O
there O
many O
people O
who O
have O
mild O
infections O
or O
asymptomatic O
infections O
that O
we O
are O
missing O
, O
" O
said O
the O
senior O
health O
official B-PER
, O
adding O
that O
such O
information O
would O
be O
vital O
for O
the O
understanding O
of O
the O
transmission O
and O
epidemiology O
of O
the O
disease O
. O

He O
said O
that O
the O
absence O
of O
that O
kind O
of O
information O
made O
it O
very O
hard O
to O
peer O
into O
the O
whole O
picture O
and O
make O
predictions O
. O

He O
also O
listed O
three O
possibilities O
of O
the O
disease O
' O
s O
future O
development O
: O
simply O
fading O
away O
, O
the O
ongoing O
pattern O
continuing O
for O
some O
period O
of O
time O
or O
more O
cases O
or O
outbreaks O
appearing O
. O

Fukuda B-PER
told O
reporters O
that O
based O
on O
the O
current O
situation O
and O
gaps O
in O
knowledge O
, O
WHO B-ORG
decided O
to O
convene O
an O
International O
Health O
Regulations O
( O
IHR O
) O
Emergency O
Committee O
next O
week O
. O

" O
The O
reason O
why O
we O
will O
do O
this O
is O
that O
recognizing O
what O
we O
see O
and O
what O
we O
don O
' O
t O
see O
. O

We O
really O
want O
be O
in O
a O
position O
to O
be O
ready O
for O
any O
possibility O
, O
and O
we O
want O
countries O
to O
be O
in O
positions O
to O
be O
ready O
for O
any O
possible O
directions O
that O
the O
virus O
can O
take O
, O
" O
explained O
the O
assistant O
director B-PER
- O
general O
. O

" O
If O
in O
the O
future O
we O
do O
see O
some O
kind O
of O
explosions O
, O
or O
if O
there O
is O
some O
big O
outbreak O
, O
or O
we O
think O
that O
the O
situation O
has O
really O
changed O
, O
we O
will O
already O
have O
a O
group O
of O
emergency O
committee O
experts O
who O
are O
really O
up O
to O
speed O
, O
so O
that O
we O
don O
' O

have O
to O
go O
through O
a O
steep O
learning O
curve O
, O
" O
Fukuda B-PER
said O
, O
" O
we O
just O
want O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
we O
can O
move O
as O
quickly O
as O
possible O
if O
we O
need O
to O
move O
in O
the O
future O
in O
any O
major O
directions O
. O
" O

Fukuda B-PER
furthered O
that O
to O
convene O
an O
IHR O
emergency O

would O
allow O
the O
WHO B-ORG
Director B-PER

General O
and O
the O

to O
receive O
input O
from O
an O
external O
group O
of O
experts O
who O
would O
provide O
formal O
consultation O
and O
information O
. O

It O
was O
introduced O
that O
the O
IHR O
emergency O

on O

was O
the O
second O

up O
under O
the O
WHO B-ORG
rules O
which O
came O
into O

in O

. O

The O
first O

was O
convened O
in O
response O
to O
2009 O
H1N1 O
pandemic O
. O

Fukuda B-PER
introduced O
that O
next O
Tuesday O
, O
and O
also O
next O
Thursday O

, O
WHO B-ORG
would O

fields O
and O
whose O
names O
to O
be O
get O
publicly O
known O
on O
next O
Monday O
. O

The O
committee O
would O
be O
provided O
with O
information O
that O
WHO B-ORG
has O
and O
then O
review O
the O
situation O
, O
with O
part O
of O

coming O
from O

could O
directly O
tell O
the O
committee O
members O
their O
perspectives O
and O
concerns O
, O
as O
Fukuda B-PER
noted O
, O
and O
then O
it O
would O
be O
asked O
to O
provide O
views O
on O
whether O
the O
event O
constitutes O
a O
public O
health O

of O

to O
protest O
the O
recent O

. O

Despite O
initial O
worries O
, O
the O
demonstration O
was O
largely O
peaceful O
, O
with O
the O
police B-ORG
estimating O
that O
about O
150 O
, O

people O
took O
part O
. O

Separately O
, O
the O
French B-GPE

said O
they O
were O

Saturday O
evening O
, O
an O
act O
that O
may O
have O
been O
inspired O
by O
the O
murder O

a O
British B-GPE
soldier B-PER
last O

in O
retaliation O
for O
Western B-LOC
military O
intervention O
in O
Muslim O
countries O
. O

The O
anti O
- O
gay O

march O
occurred O
as O
a O
recent O

the O

against O
the O
“ O

law O
that O
passed O

The O
demonstrations O
have O
broadened O
to O
include O
those O
angry O
at O
the O

for O
his O
overall O
leadership O
and O
some O
far O

who O
have O
been O
violent O
. O

Marchers O
converged O
from O
three O
parts O
of O
Paris B-GPE
to O
the O
esplanade B-FAC
in O

of O
the O
Invalides B-FAC
. O

There O
was O
a O
separate O
, O
smaller O
march O
by O
conservative O
Christians O
. O

In O
general O
, O
the O
demonstrations O
against O
the O
law O
have O
been O
a O
combination O
of O
religious O
leaders O
and O
their O
followers O
, O
opposed O
to O
the O
gay O
marriage O
on O
religious O
grounds O
, O
and O
more O
conservative O
French O
, O
many O
of O
them O
Roman B-GPE
Catholic O
, O
who O
believe O
that O
gay O
couples O
should O
have O
equal O
rights O
, O
but O
within O
an O
institution O
other O
than O
marriage O
. O

Many O
also O
object O
to O
the O
new O
ability O
of O
gay O
married O
couples O
to O
adopt O
children O
, O
arguing O
that O
a O
child O
should O
be O
raised O
by O
a O

According O

the O

I O
imagine O

Tornadoes O
seem O
to O
be O
the O
most O
dangerous O

I O
know O

scare O
me O
the O
most O
. O

more O

nothing O
can O

I O
' O

I O
spent O
90 O

so O
perhaps O
that O
is O
just O
my O
ignorance O
of O
the O

The O
devastation O
in O
Moore B-GPE
is O
horrible O
. O

I O
did O
read O
at O

a O
little O
news O
where O
they O
had O
the O
death O
toll O
at O

figured O
out O
they O
double O
counted O
some O
so O
the O
number O
when O
down O
to O
24 O

( O

) O

For O
me O
, O
I O
would O
say O
that O
was O
enough O
and O
get O
the O
F O
out O

Moving O
may O
not O
be O
that O
easy O
for O
some O
depending O
upon O
their O
job O

situation O

I O
do O

the O
best O

I O

one O
thing O
here O

this O
is O
already O
the O
3th O

this O
happens O
in O

avoid O
having O
to O
teach O
. O

Both O
sides O
play O
dirty O
games O
, O
I O
can O
' O
t O
say O
I O
support O
either O
side O
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
have O
kids O
, O
so O
I O
am O
not O
affected O
directly O
, O
but O
it O
just O
seems O
to O
be O
non O
- O
stop O
fights O
with O
this O
union B-ORG
. O

Seems O
the O
government B-ORG
saves O
X O
amount O
every O
day O
they O
don O
' O
t O
work O
, O
and O
some O
say O
that O
is O
why O
the O
government B-ORG
is O
in O
no O
hurry O
to O
settle O
, O
but O
I O
don O
' O
t O
know O
how O
accurate O
these O
reports O
are O
. O

Maybe O
teachers O
should O
work O
for O
individual O
districts O
directly O
, O
with O
each O
district O
negotiating O
the O
contract O
, O
and O
not O
one O
contract O
for O
all O
as O
it O
appears O
it O
is O
in O
BC B-GPE
. O

Then O
at O
- O
least O
the O
entire O
province O
would O
not O
be O
on O
strike O
at O
once O
. O

We O
have O
a O
few O
teachers O
who O
are O
friends O
who O
are O
totally O
hacked O
off O
with O
the O
whole O
thing O
. O

What O
started O
off O
as O
a O
" O
moral O
" O
crusade O
( O
with O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
payrise O
on O
the O
side O
( O
? O
? O
! O
? O
? O
) O
) O

seems O
to O
have O
become O
hijacked O
by O
the O
Unions O
. O

Apparently O
the O
teachers O
didn O
' O
t O
realise O
there O
wasn O
' O
t O
a O
strike O
fund O
kitty O
left O
. O

They O
thought O
they O
' O
d O
still O
get O
some O
money O
. O

They O
' O
re O
also O
acutely O
aware O
their O
popularity O
amongst O
parents O
now O
scrambling O
for O
childcare O
- O
or O
shelling O
out O
$ O
80 O
a O
day O
for O
2 O
in O
daycare O
- O
has O
diminished O
dramatically O
. O

As O
a O
parent B-PER
with O
a O
couple O
of O
kids O
in O
the O
system O
, O
when O
someone O
else O
' O
s O
fight O
directly O
affects O
my O
pocket O
, O
my O
sympathies O
begin O
to O
stretch O
rather O
thin O
( O
not O
that O
I O
support O
Union O
fuelled O
disputes O
in O
general O
anyway O
) O
. O

Another O
friend B-PER
told O
me O
at O
the O
weekend O
that O
the O
starting O
pay O
for O
a O
" O
normal O
" O
teacher O
was O
in O
the O
mid O
$ O
40k O
' O
s O
- O
rising O
to O
$ O
85 O
( O
very O
ish O
) O
K O
for O
the O
top O
grade O
of O
a O
" O
normal O
" O
teacher O
. O

But O
in O
the O
Province B-GPE
as O
a O
whole O
the O
average O
salary O
of O
a O
teacher O
is O
around O
$ O
78k O
, O
so O
most O
teachers O
have O
been O
in O
post O
so O
long O
they O
almost O
all O
get O
top O
whack O
already O
. O

Just O
saying O
- O
and O
I O
don O
' O
t O
know O
the O
veracity O
of O
this O
information O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O

Or O
, O
return O
the O
appropriate O
amount O
to O
taxpayers O
via O
a O
reduction O
in O
income O
/ O
property O
taxes O
, O
and O
then O
let O
the O
taxpayers O
negotiate O
directly O
with O
the O
teachers O
. O

Yeah O
, O
that O
' O
d O
work O

I O
reckon O
they O
are O
so O
whiny O
cos O
most O
teachers O
are O
married O
to O
other O
teachers O
so O
they O
end O
up O
suffering O
from O
groupthink O
like O
the O
nazis O
in O
Germany B-GPE
. O

What O
bunch O
of O
greedy O
self O
- O
absorbed O
bastards O
. O

Really O
putting O
children O
first O
. O

Apparently O
this O
strike O
will O
save O
the O
BC B-GPE
Government B-ORG
more O
than O
$ O
160 O
million O
in O

wonder O
how O
many O

men O
will O

SCOTUS B-ORG
is O
not O
interested O
in O
dealing O
with O
challenges O
. O

Yeah O
, O
because O
we O
all O
know O
how O
they O
' O
ve O
played O
it O
safe O
over O
the O
last O
20 O
odd O
years O
, O
concerning O
everything O
from O
gun O
control O
to O
gay O
marriage O
. O

He O
likes O
common O
sense O
gun O
control O
. O

they O
don O
' O
t O
get O
that O
involved O
in O
guns O
, O
at O
least O
not O
that O
I O
have O
seen O

What O
would O
law O
enforcement O
do O
anyway O
, O
past O
keeping O
an O
eye O
on O
them O
. O

No O
one O
wants O
another O
Waco B-GPE
type O
of O
situation O
. O

It O
' O
s O
only O
if O
someone O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
weaponry O
and O
ammo O
actually O
starts O
something O
that O
the O
authorities O
are O
likely O
to O
step O
in O
because O
, O
no O
other O
option O
. O

So O
LE O
gets O
all O
this O
military B-ORG
stuff O
from O
the O
government B-ORG
, O
and O
that O
makes O
the O
hoarders O
nervous O
and O
angry O
so O
they O
buy O
more O
stuff O
? O

The O
percentage O
of O
households O
with O
guns O
is O
more O
or O
less O
stable O
so O
it O
' O
s O
the O
same O
people O
amping O
up O
their O
inventory O
. O

What O
a O
mess O
, O
and O
it O
' O
s O
not O
even O
a O
mess O
yet O
. O

The O
weird O
thing O
about O
SCOTUS B-ORG
decisions O
involving O
gun O
control O
is O
that O
it O
weirdly O
aligns O
with O
conservative O
ideals O
regarding O
the O
division O
between O
the O
states O
and O
government B-ORG
, O
while O
biting O
them O
in O
the O
ass O
over O
it O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

Basically O
, O
they O
' O
ve O
gone O
on O
record O
stating O
that O
the O
federal O
government B-ORG
can O
' O
t O
impede O
the O
2nd O
amendment O
, O
which O
means O
any O
executive O
action O
Obama B-PER
takes O
will O
probably O
be O
struck O
down O
if O
it O
' O
s O
too O
vague O
or O
widespread O
. O

But O
on O
a O
state O
and O
local O
level O
? O

Well O
hell O
, O
that O
' O
s O
up O
to O
them O
. O

SCOTUS B-ORG
usually O
doesn O
' O
t O
get O
involved O
. O

I O
hope O
so O
! O

About O
time O
someone B-PER
in O
government B-ORG
has O
the O
gonads O
to O
actually O
do O
some O
work O

The O
idea O
is O
fine O
the O
means O
are O
the O
issue O
. O

I O
understand O
he O
can O
' O
t O
get O
anything O
done O
but O
if O
he O
does O
this O
then O
nothing O
will O
get O
done O
for O
a O
long O
while O
. O

Nothing O
will O
be O
done O
until O
if O
/ O
when O
the O
Republican B-ORG
Party I-ORG
collapses O
. O

But O
it O

They O
are O

priority O
. O

Except O
when O

are O
concerned O
. O

Expected O
this O
to O
happen O
. O

The O
whole O
situation O
is O
a O
mess O
, O
they O
can O
' O
t O
even O
find O
someone O
willing O
to O
be O
a O
mediator O
. O
. O

that O
to O
me O
is O
very O
telling O
. O

Not O
even O
Vince B-PER
Reddy I-PER
is O
willing O
, O
which O
is O
saying O
a O
lot O
. O

And O
yet O
somehow O
this O
dysfunctional O
gong O
- O
show O
is O
helping O
the O

. O

aaaaalrighty O
then O
. O

I O
have O
a O
friend B-PER
of O
mine O
who O
' O
s O
a O
teacher O
and O
quite O
a O
keeny O
unionised O
one O
at O
that O
. O

He O
had O
a O
summer O
of O
summer O
school O
work O
lined O
up O
to O
supplement O
his O
meagre O
$ O
70k O
+ O
10 O
monthly O
salary O
. O

He O
doesn O
' O
t O
seem O
so O
keen O
on O
the O
strike O
any O
more O
- O
now O
he O
' O
s O
going O
to O
loose O
the O
money O
he O
' O
d O
earn O
on O
top O
of O
his O
" O
normal O
" O
salary O
. O

I O
just O
didn O
' O
t O
say O
anything O
, O
but O
I O
think O
he O
' O
s O
reflecting O
on O
just O
how O
much O
his O
stance O
of O
standing O
up O
for O
the O
kids O
( O
' O
cos O
that O

what O
it O

about O

I O
' O
m O
an O

I O
value O
the O

of O

and O
the O

they O

I O
' O
m O
afraid O
that O
Google B-ORG
is O
following O
us O
more O
than O
they O
should O
be O
allowed O
to O
. O

Every O

Google B-ORG

and O
it O
occurred O
to O
me O
that O
Google B-ORG
can O
make O
a O
map O
of O
everything O
we O
do O
on O
the O

Google B-ORG

are O
on O
almost O
every O
website O
, O
and O
the O
only O
way O
we O
can O
opt O
out O
of O
Google B-ORG
altogether O
is O
to O
not O
use O

It O
' O
s O
almost O
impossible O
to O
avoid O
using O
something O
made O
by O
Google B-ORG

I O
' O
ve O
always O
wondered O
what O
kind O
of O
data O
Google B-ORG
collects O
, O
and O
have O
been O
trying O
to O
learn O
about O
this O
kind O
of O
thing O
, O
by O
reading O
all O

that O
I O
find O
on O
this O

I O
was O
wondering O
what O
you O
guys O
think O
. O

Do O
you O
mind O
Google B-ORG
recording O
everything O
you O
do O

? O

Do O
you O
think O
France B-GPE
and O
Germany B-GPE
should O
ban O
Google B-ORG

that O
violate O
our O

Should O
we O
be O

this O
kind O
of O

? O

The O
articles O
below O
talked O
a O
lot O
about O
this O
topic O
, O
and O
I O
wonder O
what O
fellow O
Apple B-ORG
owners O
think O
. O

I O
wish O
Apple B-ORG
would O
release O
a O
search O
engine O
and O
computer O
advertising O
so O
we O
wouldn O
' O
t O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
this O
stuff O
= O
/ O

You O
seem O
to O
be O
making O
Google B-ORG
out O
to O
be O
a O
bad O
guy B-ORG
and O
Apple B-ORG
to O
be O
the O
hero B-ORG
. O

I O
think O
it O
' O
s O
naive O
to O
think O
Apple B-ORG
is O
all O
innocent O
or O
any O
company O
for O
that O
matter O
. O

Plenty O
here O
have O
too O
must O
trust O
in O
Apple B-ORG

Don O
' O
t O
get O
me O
wrong O
, O
I O
like O
Apple B-ORG

. O
. O
OS O
X O

And O
Google O
with O
Android O
. O

Works O
great O
despite O
what O
you O
' O
ll O
hear O
from O
some O
users O
. O

Honestly O
, O
I O
think O
you O
' O
re O
being O
a O
bit O
paranoid O
. O

Yea O
it O
we O
' O
re O
being O
tracked O
. O

Call O
it O
Google B-ORG
, O
call O
it O
Facebook B-ORG
( O
aka O

Heck O
look O
at O
your O
iPhone O
, O
how O
do O
you O
know O
nobody O
' O
s O
listening O
to O
you O
or O
watching O
you O
? O

It O
has O
a O
built O
in O
mic O

camera O
! O

Just O
because O
it O
' O
s O
off O
doesn O
' O
t O
mean O
it O
' O
s O
off O
. O

You O
don O
' O
t O
know O
who O
has O
connections O
to O
your O
phone O
and O
who O
' O
s O
doing O
what O
with O
that O
data O
. O

Is O
that O
possible O
? O

I O
think O
so O
. O

But O
technology O
comes O
at O
a O
price O
and O
I O
don O
' O
t O
mean O
money O
. O
. O
. O

No O
I O
don O
' O
t O
wear O
a O
tin O
foil O
hat O
. O

Personally O
I O
think O
this O
is O
ridiculous O
. O

Every O
single O
company O
that O
is O
involved O
with O
software O
, O
the O
Internet O
, O
mobile O
devices O
, O
search O
and O
advertising O
is O
tracking O
you O
. O

I O
have O
never O
heard O
of O
a O
single O
case O
where O
someone O
was O
harmed O
because O
of O
this O
. O

Whether O
from O
Google B-ORG
or O
any O
other O
big O
company O
like O
Apple B-ORG
, O
Microsoft B-ORG
, O
Yahoo B-ORG
or O
Bing O
( O
MS B-ORG
) O
. O

I O
just O
haven O
' O
t O
seen O
it O
. O

I O
think O
you O
should O
be O
careful O
with O
your O
information O
but O
other O
than O
that O
, O
I O
don O
' O
t O
worry O
about O
it O
. O

Use O
Bing O
for O
search O
and O
give O
Microsoft B-ORG
some O
piece O
of O
your O
information O
. O

Finally O
we O
will O
not O
avoid O
that O
kind O
of O
tracking O
as O
Google B-ORG
and O
others O
mainly O
generate O
income O
from O
ads O
. O

Not O
that O
I O
' O
m O
feeling O
too O
comfortable O
with O
it O
and O
for O

don O
' O
t O

And O
I O
use O

finally O
nothing O

The O

outlined O
a O

retreat O
from O
its O
once O

core O
handset O
business O
by O
entering O
a O
partnership O
with O
the O

The O
substantial O
loss O
, O
which O
follows O
one O
of O
nearly O
$ O
1 O
billion O
in O
the O
previous O
quarter O
, O
again O
reflected O
the O
failure O
of O
the O
BlackBerry B-ORG
10 O
line O
of O
phones O
, O
which O
were O
portrayed O
as O
a O
lifesaver O
for O
the O
company B-ORG
when O
introduced O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
year O
. O

The O
latest O

included O

mainly O
related O
to O

that O

led O

, O
compared O
with O

2 O
. O
7 O

in O
the O

period O

year O

. O

Last O
month O
, O
BlackBerry B-ORG
failed O
to O
find O
a O
buyer O
for O
the O
company B-ORG
and O
replaced O
Thorsten B-PER
Heins I-PER
, O
the O
chief O
executive B-PER
, O
with O
John B-PER
S I-PER
. I-PER
Chen I-PER
, O
the O
former O
chairman B-PER
of O
the O
software O
company B-ORG
Sybase B-ORG
. O

Chen B-PER
has O
since O
fired O
several O
high O
- O
level O
executives O
at O
the O
company B-ORG
. O

But O
the O
first O
real O
strategic O
change O
under O
Chen B-PER
came O
Friday O
, O
when O
he O
announced O
the O
company B-ORG
’ O
s O
arrangement O
with O
Foxconn B-ORG
. O

BlackBerry B-ORG
, O
like O
other O
many O
other O
hardware O
companies O
including O
Apple B-ORG
, O
has O
long O
relied O
on O
Foxconn B-ORG
to O
manufacture O
phones O
. O

The O
new O
partnership O
appears O
to O
take O
the O
relationship O
to O
a O
new O
level O
. O

The O
arrangement O
also O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
way O
for O
BlackBerry B-ORG
to O
effectively O
hand O
over O
some O
of O
its O
handset O
business O
without O
running O
afoul O
of O
Canadian B-GPE
foreign O
investment O
laws O
. O

In O
a O
conference O
call O
with O
analysts O
, O
Chen B-PER
said O
that O
BlackBerry B-ORG
would O
jointly O
develop O
and O
manufacture O
some O
phones O
with O
Foxconn B-ORG
. O

Because O
Foxconn B-ORG
will O
carry O
the O
inventory O
of O
those O
phones O
on O
its O
books O
, O
Chen B-PER
said O
that O
BlackBerry B-ORG
would O
be O
shielded O
from O
large O
writedowns O
of O
unwanted O
handsets O
in O
the O
future O
. O

In O
what O
seemed O
to O
be O
an O
even O
further O
distancing O
from O
the O
company B-ORG
’ O
s O
past O
, O
Chen B-PER
was O
remarkably O
open O
to O
the O
idea O
of O
joining O
the O
competition O
. O

“ O
I O
would O
love O
to O
find O
a O
way O
to O
make O
our O
BlackBerry B-ORG
experience O
on O
the O
Android O
and O
the O
iOS O
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
referring O
to O
the O
two O
dominant O
mobile O
operating O
systems O
. O

“ O
It O
’ O
s O
not O
without O
difficulties O
, O
as O
you O
all O
know O
. O

But O
it O
’ O
s O
something O
that O
we O
’ O
re O
very O
interested O
in O
trying O

Alternate O
History O

: O
Steve B-PER
Jobs I-PER
Is O
Never O
Fired O

Ok O
all O
you O
analysts O
, O
here O
' O
s O
another O
question O
for O
you O
. O

What O
would O
have O
happened O
if O
Steve B-PER
Jobs I-PER
had O
never O
left O
Apple B-ORG
to O
start O
with O
? O

Do O
we O
still O
have O
a O
world B-LOC
controlled O
by O
Microsoft B-ORG
? O

Do O
we O
see O
the O
iPod O
come O
much O
earlier O
? O

Does O
Apple B-ORG
still O
go O
to O
the O
IBM B-ORG
PowerPC O
chip O
or O
switch O
to O
Intel B-ORG
a O
long O
time O
ago O
? O

Would O
Apple B-ORG
have O
been O
able O
to O
pound O
Microsoft B-ORG
into O
the O
ground O
? O

Or O
do O
things O
still O
slip O
into O
the O
terrible O
mid O
90s O
that O
we O
saw O
. O

Let O
me O
know O
. O

My O
guess O
is O
that O
Apple B-ORG
gets O
torn O
apart O
. O

THere O
was O
so O
much O
in O
fighting O
and O
disagreement O
. O

It O
would O
have O
been O
messy O
. O

Ironicly O
, O
Steve B-PER
being O
fired O
was O
the O
worst O
and O
best O
thing O
tha O
happened O
. O

I O
honestly O
think O
that O
Apple B-ORG
would O
have O
died O
. O

Like O
the O
previous O
poster B-PER
said O
, O
there O
was O
so O
much O
fighting O
and O
disagreement O
. O

Plus O
, O
I O
think O
that O
leaving O
and O
establishing O
other O
companies O
helped O
focus O
Jobs B-PER
' O
talent O
into O
what O
we O
have O
today O
. O

I O
am O
not O
sure O
that O
the O
Mac O
would O
be O
in O
the O
state O
that O
is O
today O
if O
Jobs B-PER
hadn O
' O
t O
left O
. O

Steve B-PER
hired O
John B-PER
Scully I-PER
as O
CEO O
in O
1985 O
because O
Apple B-ORG
was O
in O
desperate O
need O
of O
" O
adult O
supervision O
. O
" O

Scully B-PER
brought O
the O
experience O
and O
discipline O
required O
to O
run O
a O
major O
corporation O
, O
but O
what O
he O
lacked O
was O
the O
vision O
for O
the O
future O
of O
technology O
that O
Jobs B-PER
has O
always O
possessed O
. O

When O
the O
relationship O
between O
Jobs B-PER
and O
Scully B-PER
broke O
down O
, O
and O
Jobs B-PER
departed O
, O
this O
was O
a O
bad O
day O
for O
Apple B-ORG
. O

The O
business O
end O
of O
Apple B-ORG
was O
run O
very O
well O
thereafter O
( O
some O
of O
Apple B-ORG
' O
s O
most O
profitable O
years O
followed O
) O
, O
but O
Scully B-PER
never O
really O
had O
a O
strategic O
direction O
the O
company B-ORG
, O
so O
in O
that O
respect O
, O
it O
floundered O
. O

Jobs B-PER
and O
Scully B-PER
could O
have O
made O
a O
very O
good O
team O
, O
had O
they O
stuck O
together O
. O

I O
think O
Apple B-ORG
would O
be O
a O
much O
stronger O
company O
today O
had O
the O
split O
never O
occurred O
. O

Apple B-ORG
produces O
the O
best O
machines O
in O
the O
world B-LOC
, O
charges O
$ O
10 O
, O
000 O
each O
for O
the O
entry O
level O
model O
, O
and O
goes O
out O
of O
business O
in O
1 O
year O
. O

lol O
straight O
to O
the O
point O
. O

Oy O
. O

I O
thought O
this O
might O
be O
at O
least O
a O
semi O
- O
serious O
discussion O
. O

If O
steve B-PER
Jobs I-PER
was O
never O
fired O
apple B-ORG
would O
of O
gone O
under O
. O

I O
seen O
some O
infomation O
on O
it O
and O
from O
employees O
at O
apple B-ORG
at O
the O
time O
agreed O
that O
if O
Jobs B-PER
need O
to O
go O
for O
a O
while O
. O

Yeah O
it O
hurt O
and O
it O
was O
a O
dark O
day O
since O
the O
guy B-PER
who O
took O
over O
lack O
the O
vision O
that O
Jobs B-PER
had O
. O

Jobs B-PER
biggest O
problem O
is O
his O
ego O
. O

And O
that O
ego O
was O
destoring O
the O
company B-ORG
. O

Huge O
mistakes O
where O
made O
by O
him O
( O
spliting O
the O
apple O
2 O
and O
the O
mac O
devoloment O
and O
causing O
a O
lot O
of O
tension O
and O
so O
on O
) O

In O
the O
long O
run O
it O
was O
a O
good O
thing O
Jobs B-PER
was O
fired O
. O

He O
need O
to O
get O
away O
from O
having O
influnces O
on O
the O
company B-ORG
for O
a O
while O
. O

He O
was O
to O
personly O
involved O
. O

After O
while O
of O
not O
being O
with O
the O
company B-ORG
let O
it O
gets O
a O
buniness O
side O
in O
order O
. O

When O
they O
brought O
him O
back O
Apple B-ORG
corpate O
side O
was O
in O
order O
and O
the O
problem O
was O
it O
lack O
of O
vision O
. O

Jobs B-PER
has O
a O
great O
vision O
but O
his O
corparpated O
mind O
is O
weak O
. O

Now O
apple B-ORG
is O
in O
good O
shape O
they O
have O
both O
. O

The O
only O
problem O
deals O
with O
DRM O
and O
apple B-ORG
not O
trying O
to O
push O
for O
a O
standard O
. O

Longer O
they O
wait O
the O
more O
likely O
M B-ORG
$ I-ORG
will O
be O
setting O
the O
standard O
for O
DRM O

I O
watched O
Steve B-PER
Stanford B-ORG
Commencment O
Address O
and O
he O
said O
the O
same O
thing O
basically O
. O

He O
hated O
being O
fired O
, O
but O
it O
needed O
to O
happen O
. O

Are O
we O
forgetting O
. O
. O
. O
? O

unnatural O

detected O

known O
nuclear O

site B-FAC

North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
and O
North B-GPE
Korean I-GPE
leaders O
claim O
that O
it O
was O
a O
successful O
detonation O
of O
a O
miniaturized O
nuclear O
bomb O
. O

There O
' O
s O
no O
evidence O
of O
this O
being O
genuine O
outside O
of O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
' O
s O
claims O
. O

I O
' O
m O
skeptical O
, O
but O
it O
' O
s O
best O
to O
proceed O
with O
caution O
. O

Was O
curious O
about O
the O
thoughts O
here O
. O

Update O
: O
A O
organization B-ORG
of O
the O
UN B-ORG
that O
monitors O
for O
nuclear O
activity O
stated O
that O
it O
detected O
an O
" O
unusual O
" O
even O
as O
well O
. O

Link O
: O

Its O
alright O
though O
, O
because O
Americans O
can O
own O
guns O
, O
and O
nothing O
bad O
can O
happen O
when O
you O
have O
guns O
. O

Yeah O
, O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
has O
a O
hydrogen O
bomb O
. O

I O
also O
get O
as O
hard O
as O
I O
did O
when O
I O
was O
20 O
. O

On O
a O
side O
note O
, O
I O
guess O
fish O
can O
' O
t O
really O
get O
embarrassed O
when O
they O
fart O
as O
its O
obvious O
when O
they O
do O
and O
they O
would O
just O
do O
it O
in O
front O
of O
each O
other O
like O
its O
normal O
behaviour O
. O

We O
need O
tolerance O
like O
that O
up O
here O
on O
concrete O
. O

I O
imagine O
our O
nation B-GPE
' O
s O
intelligence O
and O
photoreconnaissance O
agencies O
will O
be O
in O
for O
some O
long O
hours O
in O
the O
days O
ahead O
trying O
to O
establish O
what O
, O
exactly O
, O
went O
on O
in O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
. O

The O
" O
good O
" O
things O
about O
nuclear O
testing O
is O
that O
with O
modern O
technology O
, O
its O
possible O
for O
our O
analysts O
and O
scientists O
to O
gain O
a O
pretty O
clear O
idea O
of O
exactly O
what O
sort O
of O
weapon O
was O
tested O
, O
even O
though O
they O
cannot O
gain O
access O
to O
the O
site B-FAC
itself O
. O

Airborne O
sensors O
will O
take O
air O
samples O
looking O
for O
particular O
isotopes O
, O
and O
specifically O
the O
mix O
of O
such O
isotopes O
, O
to O
look O
for O
clues O
as O
to O
the O
process O
. O

Other O
scientists O
will O
look O
at O
the O
seismological O
data O
to O
determine O
how O
the O
explosion O
( O
if O
any O
) O
took O
place O
; O
and O
to O
gain O
a O
better O
idea O
of O
the O
potential O
explosive O
yield O
of O
any O
such O
device O
. O

My O
guess O
is O
that O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
detonated O
some O
form O
a O
a O
fission O
weapon O
that O
was O
successfully O
" O
boosted O
" O
with O
the O
addition O
of O
Tritium O
. O

Such O
" O
boosted O
" O
weapons O
, O
while O
terrifying O
and O
powerful O
; O
are O
a O
long O
way O
from O
the O
almost O
unlimited O
power O
and O
complexity O
of O
a O
full O
fusion O
weapon O
. O

It O
seems O
unlikely O
that O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
would O
be O
able O
to O
engineer O
a O
full O
fusion O
weapon O
without O
first O
conducting O
a O
far O
more O
comprehensive O
test O
program O
than O
they O
have O
previously O
. O

Though O
nothing O
is O
confirmed O
, O
most O
seem O
to O
believe O
it O
was O
a O
nuclear O
weapon O
, O
but O
not O
a O
hydrogen O
bomb O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
also O
seen O
suggestions O
that O
there O
was O
a O
natural O

My O
brother B-PER
in O

a O

here B-LOC
in O
the O
DFW O

last O
night O

was O
called O
in O
to O
help O
with O
one B-ORG
of O
the O
more O
local O
departments O
who O
were O
on O
the O
scene O

It O
' O
s O
been O
a O
crazy O
night O
from O
what O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
told O
. O

Several O
homes O
have O
been O
destroyed O
and O
the O
damage O
is O
pretty O
extensive O
. O

Certainly O
been O
a O
rough O
week O
. O

Not O
to O
be O
an O
ass O
but O
what O
the O
hell O
is O
a O
fertilizer O
plant B-FAC
doing O
in O
a O
residential O
neighborhood B-LOC
? O

I O
don O
' O
t O
know O
for O
sure O
but O
could O
be O
that O
the O
neighborhood B-LOC
built O
up O
around O
the O
plant B-FAC
. O

It O
must O
have O
been O
incredibly O
loud O
for O
the O
kid B-PER
to O
lose O
his O
or O
her O
hearing O
at O
that O
distance O
. O

Man O
that O
was O
terrible O
! O

Been O
reports O
that O
the O
blast O
was O
heard O
45 O
miles O
away O
. O

Registered O
as O
a O
2 O
. O
1 O
earthquake O
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
so O
much O
think O
it O
was O
the O
loudness O
of O
the O
blast O
that O
caused O
her O
to O
lose O
her O
hearing O
. O

It O
was O
most O
likely O
the O
pressure O
differential O
and O
sound O
blast O
that O
cause O
the O
temporary O
hearing O
loss O
. O

I O
heard O
a O
report O
on O
the O
radio O
this O
morning O
that O
this O
explosion O
registered O
on O
the O
richter B-PER
scale O
at O
a O
2 O
. O
8 O
. O

That O
is O
rather O
amazing O
( O
and O
disturbing O
) O
when O
you O
think O
about O
it O
. O

That O
makes O
sense O
. O

Thanks O
. O
. O

Do O
we O
know O
if O
this O
was O
an O
accident O
or O
other O
yet O
? O

It O
just O
seems O
far O
to O
coincidental O

OK O
, O
I O
' O
ll O
restate O
my O
question O
. O

Who O
the O
hell O
builds O
up O
homes O
, O
schools O
and O
nursing O
homes O
near O
a O
fertilizer O
plant B-FAC
? O

The O
same O
people O
who O
complain O
about O
the O
noise O
of O
an O
airport O
when O
they O
move O
in O
. O

People O
that O
work O
near O
there B-FAC
that O
don O
' O
t O
want O
a O
long O
drive O
? O

This O
has O
been O
a O
bad O
week O
for O
America B-GPE
. O

People O
who O
can O
' O
t O
afford O
to O
buy O
elsewhere O
. O
. O
. O

West B-GPE
is O
not O
a O
large O
town O
. O

The O
plant B-ORG
was O
probably O
one B-ORG
of O
the O
major O
employers O
in O
town B-GPE
, O
so O
some O
people O
might O
want O
to O
have O
lived O
nearby O
. O

As O
big O
as O
that O
explosion O
was O
, O
you O
probably O
didn O
' O
t O
need O
to O
be O
very O
close O
to O
it O
for O
your O
house O
to O
sustain O
some O
damage O
. O

Holy O
Crap O
. O

They O
are O
lucky O
they O
survived O
. O

MSNBC B-ORG

the O
local O
Congressman B-PER
about O
the O
proximity O
of O
the O
plant B-FAC
to O

homes O
, O
a O

He O
said O
it O

? O

did O
not O

this O
could O
ever O
happen O

Of O
course O
, O
it O
would O
cost O
money O
such O
as O
buying O
out O
the O

moving O

. O

Wow O
, O
that O
was O
a O
pretty O
amazing O
video O
. O

Can O
' O
t O
imagine O
how O
houses O
were O
allowed O
to O
be O
built O
so O
close O
to O
the O
plant B-FAC
. O

Texas B-GPE
has O
exceedingly O
lax O
zoning O

as O
I O
recall O
. O

Raspberry O

uses O
and O
set O
ups O
! O

hey O
guys O
! O

Just O
wanted O
to O
see O
all O
the O
projects O
people O
have O
come O
up O
with O
using O
their O
Raspberry O
pi O
. O

I O
' O
ll O
start O
, O
Using O
mine O
as O
a O
media O
centre O
. O

I O
tried O
Openelec O
but O
it O
used O
100 O

cpu O
when O
idle O
so O
moved O
on O
to O

that O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
using O
raspBMC O
for O
airplay O
music O
streaming O
from O
my O
iphone O
in O
my O
room B-FAC
. O

Did O
have O
it O
in O
the O
car O
which O
was O
cool O
but O
I O
don O
' O
t O
think O
the O
power O
supply O
was O
consistent O
enough O
as O
it O
was O
a O
bit O
dodgy O
. O

May O
get O
round O
to O
putting O
a O
proper O
PSU O
in O
sometime O
but O
they O
cost O
more O
than O
the O

itself O
so O
we O

have O

EDIT O

Oh O

when O
I O
get O

Got O
a O
case O
and O
wifi O
dongle O
for O
mine O
this O
weekend O
, O
installed O
Raspmc O
and O
connected O
it O
to O
a O
telly O
in O
our O
kitchen B-FAC
as O
haven O
' O
t O
got O
round O
to O
putting O
an O
aerial O
socket O
there B-FAC
yet O
. O

Works O
surprisingly O
well O
and O
can O
watch O
FreeView O
via O
TVcatchup O
and O
the O
terrestrial O
channels O
catchup O
services O
. O

Haven O
' O
t O
got O
my O
head O
round O
how O
to O
tag O
my O
iTunes O
media O
for O
xbmc O
yet O
though O
. O

Apart O
from O
the O
Pi O
I O
think O
I O
spent O
£ O
5 O
on O
the O
case O
, O
£ O
8 O
on O
the O
dongle O
and O
£ O
7 O
on O
an O
SD O
card O
and O
use O
the O
free O
XBMC O
remote O
on O
my O
iPhone O
. O

I O
also O
needed O
an O
old O
USB O
keyboard O
for O
initial O
setup O

If O
I O
' O
m O
honest O
though O
, O
I O
think O
I O
' O
d O
prefer O
an O
Apple B-ORG
TV O
there B-FAC
eventually O
but O
at O
the O
moment O
I O
have O
a O
perfectly O
usable O
and O
arguably O
more O
powerful O
device O
for O
around O
half O
the O
price O
. O

Using O
mine O
currently O
just O
to O
trigger O
a O
row O
of O

via O

got O
a O
pretty O
basic O

I O

on O

I O
' O

Lisbon B-GPE
customs B-ORG
service O

So O
I O
bought O
something O
from O
outside O
the O
EU B-GPE
on O
the O
internet O
. O

Nothing O
big O
, O
some O
50 O
quids O
worth O
. O

Few O
days O
later O
it O
arrived O
in O
Lisbon B-GPE
. O

And O
there B-GPE
it O
sat O
for O
nearly O
a O
month O
. O

then O
I O
get O
a O
registered O
letter O
asking O
for O
fiscal O
number O
and O
original O
invoice O
. O

Send O
that O
off O
and O
wait O
again O
. O

After O
paying O
for O
their O
services O
and O
duty O
and O
vat O
, O
I O
wonder O
why O
I O
bothered O
. O

Next O
time O
I O
will O
send O
things O
to O
friends O
in O
the O
EU B-GPE
and O
even O
with O
the O
extra O
postage O
I O
will O
get O
it O
cheaper O
and O
a O
lot O
quicker O
. O

If O
it O
' O
s O
going O
from O
one O
individual O
to O
another O
I O
believe O
it O
can O
be O
marked O
as O
a O
gift O
and O
below O
a O
set O
value O
( O
not O
sure O
what O
) O
it O
then O
becomes O
tax O
free O
however O
, O
other O
than O
that O
, O
they O
' O
re O
entitled O
to O
charge O
you O
import O
tax O
AND O
23 O
% O
IVA O
/ O
VAT O
on O
cost O
of O
item O
+ O
cost O
of O
post O
+ O
cost O
of O
packaging O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
sometimes O
had O
to O
pay O
more O
in O
duty O
than O
cost O
of O
item O
when O
shipping O
car O
spares O
from O
the O
USA B-GPE
. O

If O
it O
' O
s O
an O
expensive O
item O
it O
might O
be O
worth O
considering O
looking O
at O
VAT O
rates O
for O
different O
items O
to O
different O
EU B-GPE
countries O
. O

For O
example O
, O
some O
items O
are O
rated O
at O
23 O
% O
in O
Portugal B-GPE
but O
only O
about O
5 O
% O
in O
Denmark B-GPE
and O
it O
might O
be O
cheaper O
to O
ship O
to O
Denmark B-GPE
and O
then O
road O
transport O
/ O
courier O
from O
there B-GPE
to O
PT B-GPE
and O
the O
additional O
VAT O
/ O
IVA O
might O
not O
be O
chargeable O
. O

Supposedly O
, O
items O
under O
20 O
euros O
are O
let O
through O
without O
formalities O
. O

I O
often O
order O
small O
items O
from O
China B-GPE
, O
since O
they O
' O
re O
just O
ridiculously O
cheap O
. O

Mostly O
tools O
that O
are O
unavailable O
locally O
. O

Recently O
I O
ordered O
a O
thickness O
meter O
for O
35 O
Euros O
, O
even O
though O
I O
know O
it O
will O
take O
a O
long O
time O
and O
likely O
cost O
20 O
in O
taxes O
. O

The O
cheapest O
one O
I O
could O
get O
in O
Europe B-LOC
is O
150 O
euros O
. O

You O
could O
trans O
- O
ship O
through O
another O
EU B-GPE
country O
, O
but O
then O
you O
' O
re O
asking O
someone O
to O
receive O
it O
, O
re O
- O
address O
it O
, O
and O
take O
it O
to O
the O
post O
office O
for O
you O
. O

How O
much O
of O
your O
friend O
/ O
relative O
' O
s O
time O
did O
that O
take O
and O
what O
was O
that O
time O
worth O
? O

Also O
, O
you O
never O
know O
if O
the O
first O
country O
will O
charge O
duty O
and O
VAT O
just O
like O
Portugal B-GPE
, O
as O
they O
can O
/ O
should O
. O

Generally O
, O
I O
keep O
it O
under O
20 O
or O
order O
from O
within O
the O
EU B-GPE
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
mind O
so O
much O
the O
duty O
etc O
. O

But O
when O
they O
keep O
the O
stuff O
for O
a O
month O
without O
even O
looking O
at O
it O
, O
that O
is O
out O
of O
order O
. O

Rant O
over O
. O

I O
agree O
; O
but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
I O
realize O
there O
must O
be O
a O
mountain O
of O
post O
arriving O
daily O
. O

It O
' O
s O
amazing O
that O
they O
manage O
to O
process O
it O
at O
all O
! O

At O
least O
you O
received O
yours O

In O
2014 O
I O
had O
same O
problem O
, O
sent O
in O
the O
required O
doc O
' O
s O
, O
waited O
several O
weeks O
, O
then O
contacted O
them O
yet O
again O
, O
only O
to O
be O
informed O
the O
" O
goods O
" O
had O
been O
returned O
to O
the O
supplier B-ORG
, O
left O
it O
a O
couple O
off O
weeks O
, O
contacted O
the O
supplier B-ORG
only O
to O
be O
told O
the O
goods O
had O
never O
arrived O
! O
! O

I O
can O
only O
assume O
that O
they O
went O
" O
missing O
" O
inside O
the O
system O

Once O
I O
asked O
my O
' O
friend B-PER
' O
in O
US B-GPE
order O
something O
for O
me O
, O
to O
avoid O
the O
custom B-ORG
charge O
and O
expensive O
postage O
, O
I O
still O
haven O
' O
t O
received O
it O
, O
after O
more O
than O
1 O
year O
and O
she O
has O
left O
US B-GPE
. O

It O
' O
s O
not O
big O
thing O
but O
I O
will O
never O
do O
it O
again O
unless O
the O
person O
who O
' O
s O
doing O
it O
is O
someone O
really O
close O
to O
you O
. O

I O
did O
the O
same O
thing O
; O
I O
did O
receive O
the O
parcel O
but O
I O
had O
to O
pay O
the O
customs B-ORG
charges O
just O
the O
same O
. O

He O
' O
d O
removed O
the O
invoice O
and O

The O
Westgate B-FAC

a O
place B-FAC
we O
know O
very O
well O
. O

Terrible O
news O
. O

I O
suspect O
there O
will O
be O
local O
retribution O
on O
the O
streets O
of O
Nairobi B-GPE

I O
have O
a O
Kenyan B-GPE
friend B-PER
who O
lives O
in O
Nairobi B-GPE
, O
thankfully O
he O
and O
his O
family O
weren O
' O
t O
out O
shopping O
. O

What O
is O
wrong O
with O
these O
people O
? O

Religion O
of O
Peace O
. O
. O
. O

as O
we O
have O
discussed O
before O
not O
all O
muslims O
are O
terrorists O
and O
not O
all O
terrorists O
are O
muslims O

I O
don O
' O
t O
proscribe O
Muslims O
per O
see O
, O
it O
' O
s O
the O
religion O
that O
I O
strongly O
dislike O
due O
to O
its O
ethnosupremacist O
and O
conquering O
mindset O
. O

Terrible O
news O
story O
to O
see O
. O

Lots O
of O
stories O
of O
people O
being O
stuck O
, O
hidden O
in O
the O
mall B-FAC
, O
must O
be O
terrifying O
. O

Fingers O
crossed O
no O
more O
people O
die O
and O
those O
responsible O
are O
punished O
. O

great O
word O

but O
it O
' O
s O
not O
all O
muslims O
that O
have O
that O
attitude O
. O

Agreed O
. O

Problem O
is O
that O
the O
punished O
become O
martyrs O
, O
at O
least O
potentially O
. O

Indeed O
. O

Unfortunately O
this O
is O
the O
world O
we O
live O
in O
. O

Have O
there O
been O
any O
condemnation O
statements O
from O
Muslim O
leaders O
on O
the O
World B-LOC
stage O
? O

I O
don O
' O
t O
mean O
by O
Kingston B-GPE
' O
s O
local O
Iman B-PER
who O
will O
be O
petrified O
that O
his O
mosque B-FAC
will O
be O
torched O
, O
but O
by O
muslim O
governments O
? O

I O
hope O
so O
. O

Wherever O
there O
are O
Muslims O
, O
there O
' O
s O
trouble O
. O

They O
spend O
most O
of O
their O
time O
killing O
each O
other O
, O
so O
they O
' O
re O
not O
going O
to O
have O
much O
respect O
for O
other O
religions O
. O

Sure O
there O
are O
good O
muslims O
but O
they O
have O
a O
herd O
mentality O
programmed O
to O
never O
criticise O
their O
own O
and O
those O
in O
the O
Arab B-LOC
world O
especially O
are O
brainwashed O
from O
birth O
. O

It O
' O
s O
not O
even O
a O
religion O
, O
it O
' O
s O
a O
death O
cult O
. O

Whenever O
I O
travel O
the O
local O
kids O
are O
usually O
very O
cute O
and O
inquisitive O
about O
strangers O
; O
when O
I O
go O
back O
to O
the O
Middle B-LOC
East I-LOC
they O
chuck O
stones O
and O

" O

been O
crucial O
to O
its O
success O

The O

My O

Container O
Delivery O

I O
am O
to O
check O
that O
the O
container O
provided O
by O
the O
shipping O
company O
is O
free O
of O
smells O
and O
leaks O
( O
closing O
all O
doors O
and O
looking O
for O
sunlight O
/ O
holes O
) O
. O

I O
have O
read O
even O
the O
smallest O
leaks O
can O
create O
water O
problems O
. O

Any O
bad O
smells O
are O
likely O
to O
transfer O
over O
to O
our O
belongings O
. O

The O
reasons O
for O
a O
sole O
- O
use O
20ft O
container O
are O
: O

I O
want O
to O
pack O
it O
myself O
I O
don O
' O
t O
want O
to O
share O
with O
someone O
and O
increase O
the O
chances O
of O
mix O
- O
ups O
, O
loss O
or O
damage O
from O
excessive O
handling O
As O
soon O
as O
the O
container O
is O
packed O
I O
want O
it O
shipped O
, O
I O
don O
' O
t O
want O
to O
wait O
I O
can O
easily O
fill O
a O
20ft O
container O
, O
so O
any O
cost O
savings O
on O
sharing O
will O
be O
minimal O

Bristol B-FAC
Port I-FAC

I O
intend O
to O
have O
a O
20ft O
container O
delivered O
to O
a O
storage O
facility B-FAC
, O
where O
our O
effects O
are O
already O
packed O
into O
boxes O
. O

I O
estimate O
around O
2 O
- O
3 O
hours O
to O
load O
everything O
on O
properly O
. O

I O
am O
to O
ensure O
that O
heavy O
items O
are O
at O
the O
back O
, O
lighter O
towards O
the O
front O
. O

Ratchet O
straps O
may O
be O
required O
to O
ensure O
that O
items O
are O
really O
secure O
in O
the O
container O
. O

I O
may O
consider O
getting O
hold O
of O
some O
tarp O
to O
cover O
the O
boxes O
and O
furniture O
. O

The O

Shipping O
can O

around O
2 O
months O
, O
so O
if O
I O
want O
items O
in O
Australia B-GPE
by O

, O
I O
ought O
to O
have O
them O
on O
a O

by O
August O
1st O
. O

I O
will O
take O
out O

I O
will O

if O
I O

Arrival O

checked O
over O
by O
the O
AQIS B-ORG
. O

Having O
an O

that O

of O

should O
greatly O
help O

process O
up O
and O
reduce O
the O
amount O
of O

and O
complications O
. O

I O
have O

that O

up O

3 O

Any O

? O

The O

and O
arrange O
the O

Obamacare B-PER

This O
article O
says O
Obamacare B-PER
means O
people O
would O
be O
entitled O
to O
purchase O
healthcare O
and O
then O
says O
people O
would O
be O
compelled O
to O
purchase O
healthcare O
. O

Which O
is O
correct O
? O

Many O
people O
previously O
couldn O
' O
t O
get O
coverage O
due O
to O
pre O
- O
existing O
conditions O
. O

They O
now O
cannot O
be O
denied O
coverage O
. O

However O
they O
do O
have O
to O
buy O
insurance O
if O
they O
are O
not O
covered O
under O
an O
employer O
scheme O
or O
similar O
. O

There O
are O
subsidies O
for O
the O
low O
- O
paid O
. O

The O
bill O
is O
a O
compromise O
which O
keeps O
insurance O
companies O
happy O
. O

The O
current O
( O
pre O
- O
Obamacare B-PER
) O
set O
- O
up O
means O
that O
uninsured O
people O
present O
at O
emergency O
rooms O
. O

If O
they O
cannot O
pay O
the O
hospital O
bill O
, O
they O
are O
driving O
up O
the O
costs O
for O
others O
. O

But O
some O
who O
are O
used O
to O
this O
arrangement O
prefer O
it O
to O
having O
to O
pay O
something O
. O

Also O
they O
are O
fed O
a O
lot O
of O
scare O
stories O
about O
' O
socialized O
medicine O
' O
and O
how O
it O
will O
kill O
you O
. O

It O
is O
compulsory O
and O
it O
isn O
' O
t O
. O

I O
think O
this O
explains O
it O
quite O
well O
: O

Basically O
, O
if O
you O
are O
not O
covered O
by O
your O
employer O
, O
you O
will O
have O
to O
purchase O
it O
if O
your O
income O
is O
above O
a O
certain O
level O
. O

That O
sounds O
reasonable O
and O
is O
long O
overdue O
. O

It O
' O
s O
good O
that O
Obama B-PER
is O
finally O
showing O
some O
backbone O
on O
something O
. O

Let O
' O
s O
not O
forget O
some O
things O
though O
. O

like O
Arroyo B-PER
, O
was O
eliminated O
in O
the O
preliminary O
mayoral O

last O
month O
- O
- O
the O
process O
of O
deciding O
whom O
to O
back O
was O
more O
deliberate O
. O

He O
met O
with O
John B-PER
Connolly I-PER
at O
Haley B-FAC

the O
Dudley B-LOC
Square I-LOC
coffee O

Then O
he O
met O

decided O
they O
were O
closer O
to O
each O
other O
on O
both O
style O
and O

there O
the O

in O
doing O
so O
, O
possibly O
changing O
the O
calculus O
of O
the O

’ O

. O

Together O
they O
boost O
Walsh B-PER
among O
constituencies O
with O
which O
he O
was O
expected O
to O
struggle O
. O

The O
backing O
of O
these O

dents O
the O
Âstereotype O
of O
Walsh B-PER
as O
just O
a O
union O

from O
Dorchester B-LOC
who O
cannot O
hope O
to O
win O
enough O

outside O
that O
base B-LOC

The O
support O
of O
Barros B-PER
, O
who O
made O
just O
as O
much O
of O
an O
issue O
of O
the O
schools O
as O
Connolly B-PER
, O
helps O
address O
the O
notion O
that O
Connolly B-PER
is O
the O
only O
finalist B-PER
who O
is O
serious O
about O
improving O
the O

or O
whatever O
that O
was O

- O
quickly O

Connolly B-PER
promptly O
called O
for O

face O
serious O

For O
him O
, O
this O

But O
Walsh B-PER
handled O
it O
well O

too O

unequivocally O
that O
the O

should O
immeÂdiately O
get O

it O

while O

Aluminium O

the O

pro O
- O

bracket O

They O
can O
make O

less O

so O
they O
need O
a O
lot O
less O

compared O
to O
if O
every O

With O

maybe O
only O
one O

8th O

one O

Aluminum O

quite O

Hmm O
i O
thought O

I O
think O
the O

little O
to O

we O

I O
don O
' O

there O
' O
s O
some O
conspiracy O

cut O

the O

This O
is O
much O

What O
does O

have O
to O
do O
with O
the O

If O
the O
supply O

constrained O
then O
the O
prices O

be O
raised O

the O

regardless O

how O

raw O
material O

available O

Classic O
examples O
being O
diamonds O
or O
oil O

For O
example O
, O
OPEC B-ORG
can O
manipulate O

prices O
up O

down O
by O
how O
much O

they O

regardless O
of O
how O

Unless O

buyers O

it O

' O
t O
how O

I O

if O
it O
is O
true O
what O
Nigella B-PER
said O
about O
taking O

twice O
in O

life O

I O
used O
to O
read O
the O
weekly O

It O
was O
dreadfully O

how O
he O

and O
no O
way O
would O
I O
ever O
condone O
drug O
taking O
- O
I O
think O
I O
can O
understand O
why O
Nigella B-PER
said O
in O
Court B-ORG
that O
she O
took O
cocaine O
with O
her O
husband B-PER
. O

Her O
ex O
- O
spouse B-PER
Charles B-PER
Saatchi I-PER
was O
almost O
certainly O
a O
bully B-PER
and O
her O
self O
- O

must O
have O
been O

I O
imagine O
that O
she O
just O
wanted O
to O
have O
some O
kind O
of O
brief O
respite O
and O
stupidly O
took O
cocaine O
again O

It O
is O

openly O
admitted O

my O

is O
that O
an O

to O

Where O

idea O
is O
that O
having O
to O
pay O
a O
fine O
stops O
Google B-ORG
from O

So O
the O
important O
thing O
is O
Google B-ORG
paying O
out O

Who O
receives O
it O
is O
secondary O

Does O
anyone O

Paying O

5 O

means O
nothing O

a O

This O
whole O
" O

I O
thought O
her O
question O
to O
Obama B-PER
a O
trifle O
odd O
too O

I O
came O
up O
with O
two O
conclusions O
: O

1 O
) O
She O
doesn O
' O
t O
read O
/ O
listen O
to O
the O
proposals O
, O
preferring O
only O
to O
listen O
to O
her O
political O
representative B-PER
' O

2 O
) O
She O
' O
s O
mentally O
unbalanced O
and O
, O
because O
of O
her O
medical O
record O
, O
bought O
her O
gun O
/ O
s O
from O
somewhere O
that O
didn O
' O
t O
require O
background O
checks O
. O

I O
' O
m O
leaning O
towards O
# O
2 O
. O

That O
' O
s O
true O
I O
suppose O
. O

Similar O
to O
banning O
private O
car O
ownership O
, O
they O
started O
out O
by O
making O
seat O
belts O
compulsory O
. O

What O
would O
that O
somewhere O
be O
? O

Where O
' O
s O
the O
part O
about O
death O
threats O
? O

Let O
me O
think O
. O
. O
. O
. O
hmmmmm O

How O
about O
anywhere O
that O
a O
background O
check O
isn O
' O
t O
required O
, O
would O
you O
like O
a O
list O
of O
types O
of O
sellers O
that O
can O
sell O
guns O
under O
those O
conditions O
? O

What O
exactly O
is O
the O
point O
of O
making O
shops O
perform O
background O
checks O
if O
private O
sellers O
don O
' O
t O
have O
to O
? O
? O
? O

Anybody O
who O
wants O
a O
gun O
but O
wants O
to O
remain O
under O
the O
radar O
doesn O
' O
t O
need O
an O
IQ O
of O
much O
more O
than O
40 O
to O
work O
out O
where O
not O
to O
buy O
one O
. O

what O
is O
all O
the O
palaver O
about O
private O
individuals O
who O
sell O
a O
gun O
at O
a O
gun O
show O
? O

When O
I O
use O
the O
term O
' O
gun O
seller O
' O
I O
assume O
it O
to O
mean O
a O
person O
that O
sells O
a O
gun O
/ O
guns O
regardless O
of O
their O
business O
status O

Ask O
Obama B-PER
. O

If O
I O
want O
to O
buy O
a O
gun O
from O
my O
Neighbour B-PER
, O
who O
actually O
has O
one O
I O
would O
like O
, O
I O
need O
to O
pass O
a O
background O
check O
. O

I O
guess O
he O
could O
sell O
it O
to O
me O
illegally O
, O
pretty O
sure O
he O
would O
not O
. O

Nothing O
more O
than O
a O
silly O
call O
to O
emotion O
, O
that O
I O
can O
see O
. O

We O
can O
agree O

that O

So O
why O

do O
it O

He O
will O
be O
the O
first O
pope O
to O
resign O
in O
nearly O
600 O
years O
, O
meaning O
that O
for O
the O
first O
time O

there O
will O
be O
a O
living O
former O

Papal O
resignation O
, O
which O
has O
happened O
four O
times O
before O

is O
envisaged O
as O
a O
possibility O
in O

at O
the O
only O
conditions O
that O
it O

The O
best O
known O
example O
involved O
Pope O
Celestine B-PER
V I-PER
in O
1294 O
, O
who O
after O
five O
months O
as O
the O
bishop B-PER

Rome B-GPE
issued O
a O
decree O
declaring O
it O
possible O
that O

The O
last O
time O
that O
a O

was O
Pope O
Gregory B-PER

the O

scandal O
. O

She O
is O
caught O
speaking O
about O
emails O
and O
not O
wanting O
to O
use O
govt B-ORG
emails O
due O
to O
wanting O
to O
keep O

having O
them O
come O
up O

. O

She O
is O
exposed O

No O
wonder O
she O
wanted O
to O
hide O
her O
server O
. O

No O
wonder O
she O
deleted O
all O
her O

The O
video O
also O
shows O
how O
Clinton B-PER
' O
s O
claim O
that O
she O
barely O
knew O
Peter B-PER
Paul I-PER
was O
false O
, O
and O
how O
she O
under O

him O
by O

And O
the O

' O

response O

and O
the O
right O
is O
foaming O
at O
the O
mouth O
. O

Fine O
. O

Let O
us O
elect O
Bernie B-PER
then O
. O

So O
I O
see O
we O
' O
re O
all O
trusting O
the O
MSM O
today O
. O

Actually O
having O
watched O
the O
video O
, O
I O
am O
not O
sure O
she O
' O
s O
admitting O
much O
. O

Management O
at O
my O
institution B-ORG
often O
will O
not O
use O
e O
- O
mail O
because O
it O
leaves O
a O
paper O
trial O
. O

You O
just O
know O
when O
you O
' O
re O
getting O
a O
phone O
call O
that O
it O
' O

going O
to O
be O
a O
crap O

. O

However O
, O
using O
alternatives O
to O
e O

is O
not O
a O
crime O
. O

I O
am O
sure O
most O
of O
the O
people O
in O
Congress B-ORG
and O
running O
for O
President O
have O
done O
exactly O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

What O
is O
" O
it O
" O
? O

The O
video O
is O
from O
before O
the O
2008 O
election O
, O
before O
she O
ever O
knew O
she O
was O
going O
to O
be O
Secretary O
of O
State B-ORG
. O

Honestly O
, O
do O
you O
ever O
tire O
of O
spewing O
argle O
- O
bargle O
? O

Yes O
, O
as O
much O
as O
I O
distrust O
Hillary B-PER
, O
I O
' O
m O
not O
sure O
this O
proves O
anything O
. O

It O
' O
s O
pretty O
much O
common O
knowledge O
not O
to O
write O
an O
email O
of O
something O
you O
don O
' O
t O
want O
there O
to O
be O
a O
record O
of O
. O

It O
also O
suggests O
nothing O
of O
government B-ORG
email O
specifically O
. O

In O
the O
broad O
context O
of O
investigations O
, O
her O
personal O
email O
can O
be O
used O
in O
investigations O
- O
just O
as O
it O
is O
now O
. O

Even O
without O
a O
warrant O
to O
investigate O
her O
server O
, O
if O
someone O
recieved O
an O
incriminating O
email O
from O
her O
and O
submitted O
as O
evidence O
, O
then O
you O
still O
have O
evidence O
of O
a O
paper O
trail O
. O

Although O
it O
was O
long O
before O
she O
became O
Secretary O
of O

, O
it O
shows O
that O
back O
then O
she O
was O
concerned O

Passing O

That O

It O
’ O

The O
water O

from O
the O
Heritage B-ORG

has O
been O
too O
busy O

avoiding O
any O

anything O
that O
hasn O
’ O

been O
poll O

. O

First O
, O
Rubio B-PER
opposed O
immigration O

Then O
he O
supported O
a O
piecemeal O
approach O
. O

Then O
he O
was O
in O
favor O
of O
comprehensive O
legislation O
. O

Now O
he O
’ O

signed O
up O
again O
for O
piecemeal O

He O
opposed O
the O
Affordable O

disappeared O
when O

Ted B-PER

attempted O

blow O
up O
the O
economy O
with O
C O

Then O
he O
materialized O
again O
as O
an O
ardent O
foe B-PER
of O

just O
as O
the O

proved O
to O
have O
fewer O

the O

Now O
Rubio B-PER
is O
against O
the O

Act O
because O
. O
? O
. O
? O

well O
, O
it O
prohibits O

Really O

be O
said O
of O
a O

who O
once O
served O

Perhaps O
something O
along O

lines O

Marco B-PER
Rubio I-PER
once O
represented O
Florida B-GPE
in O
the O
United B-ORG

He O
was O
a O
man B-PER

thought O

found O
no O

that O
couldn O
’ O
t O
be O
reduced O
to O
the O
sum O

He O
believed O
in O
a O

The O
senator B-PER
was O
dedicated O
to O
furthering O
the O
one O
worthy O

he O
cared O
about O
— O
himself O
. O

He O
stood O
for O
nothing O
unless O
it O
was O
before O
the O
Iowa B-GPE
caucus O

When O
called O
upon O

he O
ran O
away O

When O
the O
going O
got O
tough O
, O
he O
was O
on O
the O
next O
plane O
to O
New B-GPE

. O

He O
gave O
good O
speeches O
and O
collected O
big O
checks O
. O

He O
staunchly O
opposed O
Fidel B-PER

. O

Yet O
he O
feared O
offending O
radio O
talk O
show O
hosts O
and O
the O
his O
tea O

. O

Rubio B-PER
squandered O
his O

great O

to O
enhance O
the O

of O

Thus O
causing O
everyone O
to O
not O
care O
about O
whatever O
cause O
they O
are O
protesting O
about O
. O

Pissing O
people O
off O
is O
terrible O
strategy O
. O

If O
they O
didn O
' O
t O
, O
then O
no O
one O
would O
pay O
attention O
to O
their O

This O
is O
definitely O
ONE O
way O
to O
get O

attention O
, O
it O
' O
s O
NOT O
the O
way O
to O
get O
people O
to O
care O
about O
it O
. O

Protests O
are O
viable O
and O
are O
the O
only O
recourse O
aside O
from O
violence O
when O
the O
system O
fails O
you O
. O

Labor O
unions O
do O
this O
quite O
successfully O
, O
but O
usually O
are O
more O
orderly O
( O
strike O

although O
some O
people O
still O
get O
pissed O
about O
the O
inconvenience O

I O
' O
m O
sick O
and O
tired O
of O
hearing O
about O
these O
protests O

I O
wish O
they O
' O
d O
all O
get O
a O
job O
and O
stop O
this O
nonsense O
. O

Yes O
, O
protests O
are O
visible O
and O
one O
of O
the O
main O
ways O
to O
get O
that O
information O
out O
, O
but O
there O
has O
to O
be O
a O
better O
way O
than O
blocking O
traffic O
on O
a O
Friday O
? O

At O
that O
point O
, O
all O
they O
are O
going O
to O
accomplish O
is O
to O
piss O
people O
off O
and O
then O
the O
message O
gets O
lost O
. O

Just O
like O
when O
the O
people O
looted O
and O
burned O
buildings O
and O
cars O
after O
the O
verdict O
. O

It O
does O
no O
good O
at O
all O
for O
the O
cause O
. O

Yes O
. O

When O
I O
see O
of O
gangs O
shutting O
down O

( O
causing O
people O
to O
be O
late O
picking O
up O
their O

missing O
their O

) O
and O
generally O
causing O
mayhem O
, O
what O
sympathy O
I O
may O
have O
had O
for O
their O
cause O
evaporates O
. O

Yes O
, O
because O
being O
inconvenienced O
in O
traffic O
is O
way O
more O
important O
than O
shining O
a O

on O

If O
this O

. O

The O
gun O
group B-ORG
has O
been O
running O
an O
ad O
in O
West B-GPE
Virginia I-GPE
accusing O
Manchin B-PER
of O
siding O
with O
President O
Barack B-PER
Obama I-PER
and O
Mayor O
Michael B-PER
R I-PER
. I-PER
Bloomberg I-PER
of O

an O
ardent O
proponent B-PER

who O
has O
been O
waging O
his O
own O
campaign O
against O
senators O
who O
do O
not O
support O
gun O

. O

A O
Manchin B-PER

aide B-PER
said O
that O
the O
ad O
buy O
was O
about O
$ O
100 O
, O
000 O
, O
enough O
to O
rival O
the O
NRA B-ORG
’ O
s O
campaign O
. O

He O
had O
a O
dream O
. O
. O
. O

On O
MLK B-PER
day O
, O
all O
the O
media O
seem O
to O
be O
going O
on O
about O
is O
" O
does O
Obama B-PER
' O
s O
election O
mean O
MLK B-PER
' O
s O
dream O
came O
true O
? O
" O

The O
very O
fact O
that O
they O
have O
to O
still O
ask O
that O
question O
tells O
me O
" O
no O
" O
. O

Thoughts O
? O

He O
' O
s O
a O
bi O
- O
racial O
politician O
. O

He O
was O
the O
best O
choice O
out O
of O
the O
two O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O
and O
quite O
frankly O
I O
don O
' O
t O
think O
he O
can O
walk O
on O
water O
- O
don O
' O
t O
want O
him O
to O
, O
just O
want O
him O
to O
try O
and O
figure O
out O
the O
mess O
that O
Bush B-PER
left O
behind O
. O

Walking O
on O
water O
is O
probably O
the O
easier O
of O
the O
two O
. O

And O
that O
has O
what O
to O
do O
with O
my O
question O
? O

You O
asked O
about O
" O
his O
" O
election O
- O
and O
I O
made O
comment O
on O
" O
him O
" O
Has O
MLK B-PER
' O
s O
dream O
come O
true O
? O

That O
a O
bi O
- O
racial O
politician B-PER
has O
been O
elected O
president O
? O

I O
don O
' O
t O
know O
, O
I O
suppose O
. O

How O
' O
s O
that O
? O

Agree O
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
have O
much O
knowledge O
of O
USA B-GPE
politics O
but O
I O
don O
' O
t O
recall O
anyone O
mentioning O
the O
colour O
of O
Bush B-PER
' O
s O
skin O
when O
he O
was O
elected O
. O

It O
' O
s O
more O
like O
a O
nightmare O

So O
you O
read O
half O
the O
question O
and O
then O
replied O
to O
a O
questioin O
which O
hadn O
' O
t O
been O
posed O
. O
. O
. O
OK O
. O
. O
. O
some O
things O
never O
change O
. O

If O
you O
didn O
' O
t O
have O
an O
opinion O
, O
why O
post O
at O
all O
? O

probably O
because O
out O
of O
41 O
blokes O
to O
hold O
the O
office O
before O
him O
, O
41 O
had O
the O
same O
skin O
colour O
as O
him O

I O
thought O
he O
was O
43 O
. O

Bush B-PER
and O
the O
thoughts O
of O
Mc B-PER
Cain I-PER
/ O
Palin B-PER
frightened O
the O
US B-GPE
so O
much O
the O
forgot O
about O
being O
racist O

What O
colour O
was O
the O
other O
one B-PER
' O
s O
skin O
? O

which O
other O
one O
? O

GWB B-PER
was O
/ O
is O
the O
43rd O
president B-PER
. O

According O
to O
your O
post O
, O
of O
his O
42 O
predecessors O
, O
41 O
had O
the O
same O
colour O
skin O
as O
him O
. O

What O
about O
the O
other O
one B-PER
? O

Ping O
! O

Gerald B-PER
Ford I-PER
was O
not O
elected O
. O
. O
. O
. O

Bush B-PER
is O
the O
" O
43rd O
president B-PER
" O
but O
there O
have O
only O
been O
42 O
actual O
presidents O
, O
including O
Gerald B-PER
Ford I-PER
. O

Good O
quiz O
question O
, O
this O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O

Because O
I O
' O
m O
annoyed O
that O
this O
is O
all O
tied O
into O
MLK B-PER
in O
the O
first O
place O
. O

Yes O
, O
he O
' O
s O
the O
first O
" O
black O
" O
president B-PER
. O
. O
. O
. O
but O
so O
much O
hoopla O
is O
being O
made O
over O
an O
elected O
politician B-PER
for O
christsakes O
! O

Don O
' O
t O
get O
me O
wrong O
, O
I O
' O
m O
glad O
he O
won O
, O
I O
voted O
for O
him O
. O

But O
I O
didn O
' O
t O
vote O
for O
him O
because O
he O
was O
a O
black O
man B-PER
, O
I O
voted O
for O
him O
because O
he O
was O
the O
better O
( O
IMO O
) O
of O
the O
two O
. O

Yes O
I O
know O
this O
is O
not O
really O
answering O
your O
question O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O
Is O
this O
fulfilling O
MLK B-PER
' O
s O
dream O
? O

The O
fact O
that O
he O
was O
elected O
, O
perhaps O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
can O
run O
a O
government B-ORG
, O
one B-ORG
that O
' O
s O
screwed O
up O
royally O
, O
well O
I O
guess O
we O
' O
ll O
see O
. O

Apples B-ORG

will O
carry O

concerned O
that O
when O
CEO O
Steve B-PER

leaves O
Apple B-ORG

the O

Certainly O
, O
theres O
no O
CEO O
more O
associated O
with O

than O
Jobs B-PER

Interesting O
. O
. O
. O
. O

We O
' O
ll O
see O
about O
that O
. O

It O
didn O
' O
t O
work O
out O
so O
well O
last O
time O
. O
. O
. O

But O
last O
time O
Apple B-ORG
didn O
' O
t O
have O
the O
expertise O
in O
place O
like O
it O
does O
now O
. O

Steve B-PER
has O
a O
Apple B-ORG
going O
in O
a O
great O
direction O
and O
as O
long O
as O
they O
stay O
on O
track O
they O
' O
ll O
be O
successful O
for O
years O
to O
come O
. O

All O
it O
has O
to O
do O
is O
keep O
doing O
what O
its O
doing O
, O
which O
innovating O
some O
of O
the O
best O
products O
on O
the O
market O
and O
stay O
ahead O
of O
the O
game O
. O

I O
guess O
it O
sounds O
easy O
to O
say O
, O
but O
thats O
what O
they O
' O
re O
currently O
doing O
. O

We O
don O
' O
t O
necessarily O
need O
Steve B-PER
Jobs I-PER
to O
do O
that O
. O

There O
are O
plenty O
of O
very O
talented O
people O
at O
Apple B-ORG
to O
keep O
this O
going O
. O

Again O
, O
this O
wasn O
' O
t O
necessarily O
the O
case O
from O
the O
mid O
- O
80 O
' O
s O
to O
the O
mid O
90 O
' O
s O
where O
they O
executed O
great O
on O
all O
of O
the O
wrong O
things O
. O

They O
just O
had O
bad O
leadership O
. O

Apple B-ORG
did O
have O
poor O
leadership O
during O
the O
' O
80s O
and O
' O
90s O
, O
but O
one B-PER
of O
those O
poor O
leaders O
was O
Steve B-PER
Jobs I-PER
. O

Even O
Jobs B-PER
recognized O
his O
limitations O
, O
which O
is O
why O
he O
hired O
John B-PER
Scully I-PER
. O

The O
fact O
that O
he O
was O
able O
to O
return O
to O
Apple B-ORG
after O
12 O
years O
as O
such O
a O
completely O
transformed O
corporate O
leader B-PER
is O
one O
of O
the O
greatest O
stories O
in O
business O
. O

But O
it O
' O
s O
incorrect O
to O
believe O
that O
Apple B-ORG
went O
downhill O
because O
he O
left O
in O
1985 O
. O

If O
Jobs B-PER
had O
remained O
in O
charge O
of O
Apple B-ORG
at O
that O
time O
, O
he O
might O
well O
have O
run O
the O
company B-ORG
into O
the O
ground O
. O

Brands O
are O
based O
around O
leaders O
, O
I O
could O
reel O
off O
thousands O
of O
companies O
who O
have O
had O
a O
very O
strong O
brand O
, O
had O
a O
leadership O
change O
, O
and O
then O
gone O
through O
the O
floor O
and O
sometimes O
even O
closed O
. O

If O
this O
wasn O
' O
t O
true O
, O
then O
the O
share O
price O
of O
Apple B-ORG
wouldn O
' O
t O
have O
plummeted O
on O
the O
news O
of O
Steve B-PER
' O
s O
ill O
health O
. O

I O
really O
hope O
the O
team O
that O
successes O
the O
current O
board O
doesn O
' O
t O
mess O
things O
up O
because O
Apple B-ORG
' O
s O
in O
a O
good O
place O
at O
the O
moment O
, O
with O
$ O
20Billion O
in O
the O
bank O
, O
im O
sure O
only O
a O
few O
oil O
companies O
and O
maybe O
Microsoft B-ORG
have O
those O
kind O
of O
free O
resources O
. O

Apple B-ORG
now O
has O
more O
free O
cash O
than O
Microsoft B-ORG
( O
$ O
25 O
billion O
) O
, O
but O
mainly O
because O
Microsoft B-ORG
is O
now O
paying O
a O
dividend O
to O
stockholders O
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
think O
brands O
are O
based O
around O
leaders O
, O
they O
are O
based O
around O
companies O
and O
products O
. O

Even O
in O
its O
darkest O
days O
, O
the O
Apple B-ORG
brand O
was O
one O
of O
the O
most O
recognized O
in O
the O
world B-LOC
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
hardly O
think O
that O
brands O
are O
based O
around O
leaders O
. O

Thats O
totally O
untrue O
. O

Sure O
, O
Steve B-PER

a O

people O

Asylum O
IN O
USA B-GPE

Hello O
people O
, O
I O
am O
wondering O
what O
happens O
when O
somebody O
claims O
asylum O
at O
the O
US B-GPE
port O
of O
entry O
? O

I O
doubt O
anyone O
here O
would O
have O
much O
direct O
experience O
. O

A O
quick O
look O
on O
Google O
turned O
up O
the O
following O
: O

It O
depends O
on O
where O
attempt O
is O
made O
and O
the O
person O
' O
s O
citizenship O
/ O
nationality O
. O

The O
person O
is O
almost O
always O
detained O
either O
for O
a O
threshold O
screening O
before O
an O
asylum O
officer O
or O
to O
appear O
directly O
before O
an O
immigration O
judge O
. O

There O
is O
generally O
no O
right O
to O
bail O
/ O
bond O
for O
arriving O
aliens O
. O

Okay O
that O
' O
s O
good O
information O
to O
know O
, O
thank O
you O
for O
your O
help O
. O

Hey O
I O
read O
what O
was O
on O
that O
page O
, O
I O
' O
m O
still O
a O
little O
confused O
though O
. O
. O
. O

Would O
someone O
be O
detained O
in O
a O
detention O
facility O
then O
whilst O
waiting O
for O
their O
asylum O
to O
be O
granted O
or O
denied O
? O

There O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
variables O
such O
as O
claims O
at O
a O
border O
and O
the O
interior O
including O
affirmative O
claims O
and O
defensive O
claims O
. O

Seems O
to O
vary O
, O
more O
likely O
if O
they O
are O
from O
a O
T O
Country O
. O

It O
might O
depend O
on O
whether O
you O
' O
re O
trying O
to O
enter O
the O
USA B-GPE
with O
or O
without O
inspection O
. O

My O
brother B-PER
in I-PER
law I-PER
entered O
the O
USA B-GPE
without O
inspection O
and O
then O
claimed O
asylum O
. O

He O
was O
sent O
to O
a O
detention O
facility B-FAC
but O
bail O
was O
posted O
and O
we O
paid O
it O
. O

He O
' O
s O
been O
out O
on O
bail O
now O
, O
with O
his O
asylum O
case O
pending O
since O
January O
2007 O
. O

He O
finally O
got O
" O
the O
final O
" O
hearing O
in O
May O
2009 O
. O

We O
got O
a O
different O
lawyer B-PER
and O
filed O
an O
appeal O
, O
which O
is O
still O
pending O
. O

He O
has O
not O
yet O
had O
a O
first O
court B-ORG
date O
with O
the O
new O
case O
. O

It O
is O
not O
an O
easy O
or O
quick O
process O
, O
and O
is O
very O
expensive O
. O

Rene B-PER

Not O
sure O
if O
this O
is O
still O
the O
case O
but O
at O
Heathrow B-FAC
they O
had O
signs O
up O
what O
to O
do O
if O
you O
were O
claiming O
Asylum O
. O

They O
are O
set O
up O
for O
a O
" O
credible O
fear O
" O
interview O
. O

There O
is O
a O
set O
procedure O
for O
it O
. O

If O
one O
has O
a O
quarter O
- O
decent O
claim O
, O
they O
will O
be O
enlarged O
into O
the O
United B-GPE
States I-GPE
and O
set O
up O
for O
further O
proceedings O
. O

I O
bet O
they O
did O
. O

I O
remember O
watching O
the O
documentary O
on O
border B-LOC
control O
at O
LHR B-FAC
. O

There O
was O
an O
African B-LOC
adult B-PER
came O
in O
claiming O
to O
be O
a O
teenager O
and O
claiming O
ayslum O
due O
to O
having O
to O
commit O
murder O
or O
be O
killed O
himself O
. O

The O
UKBA B-ORG
officials O
doubted O
he O
was O
a O
teenager O
and O
surprisingly O
( O
not O
! O
) O

he O
' O
d O
lost O
all O
his O
papers O
so O
they O
had O
no O
way O
to O
find O
this O
out O
. O

The O
utter O
idiots O
at O
the O
UKBA B-ORG
then O
released O
him O
pending O
further O
police B-ORG
investigation O
. O

He O
went O
on O
the O
run O
and O
disappeared O
. O

UKBA B-ORG
and O
LHR B-FAC
appear O
to O
actively O
encourage O
people O
to O
cheat O
and O
abuse O
the O
asylum O
system O
. O

and O
pray O
what O
were O
they O
meant O
to O
do O
? O

With O
very O
limited O
detention O
space O
for O
immigration O
holds O
, O
there O
are O
strict O
guidelines O
about O
who O
can O
be O
detained O
. O

If O
the O
person O
didn O
' O
t O
meet O
the O
guidelines O
the O
detention O
facilities O
will O
not O
take O
them O
. O

Detain O
him O
until O
his O
age O
could O
be O
proven O
via O
a O
medical O
test O
. O

Instead O
they O
just O
let O
him O
go O
with O
the O
proviso O
he O
report O
to O
the O
police B-ORG
. O

And O
we O
wonder O
why O
the O
UK B-GPE
has O
been O
flooded O
with O
asylum O
seekers O
. O

It O
' O
s O
possible O
, O
yes O

Will O
it O
happen O
to O
you O

Election O
2014 O

Bring O
it O
on O
, O
I O
can O
use O
my O

this O
time O
. O

Ontario B-GPE
voters O
are O
heading O
to O
the O
polls O
next O
month O
. O

A O
June O
election O
is O
a O
certainty O
after O
NDP B-ORG
Leader O
Andrea B-PER
Horwath I-PER
said O
her O
party B-ORG
could O
not O
support O
the O
budget O
tabled O
by O
Premier O
Kathleen B-PER
Wynne I-PER
’ O
s O
minority O
Liberals B-ORG

Can O
Ontario B-GPE
even O
afford O
an O
election O

Reading O
some O
of O
the O
comments O
from O
Ontarians O
Im O
glad O
Im O
not O
living O
in O
that O
Province B-GPE
anymore O
. O

The O
liberals B-ORG
are O
hated O
after O
McGuinty B-PER
, O
the O
Cons B-ORG
are O
hated O
after O
Harris B-PER
and O
some O
still O
even O
blame O
Bob B-PER
Rae I-PER
when O
he O
was O
with O
the O
NDP B-ORG
. O

So O
as O
an O
Ontarian B-PER
who O
do O
you O
vote O
for O
? O

Regardless O
of O
who O
wins O
be O
it O
majority O
or O
minority O
that O
Province B-GPE
is O
in O
DEBT O
so O
how O
do O
you O
spend O
less O
? O

I O
can O
see O
a O
lot O
of O
Ontario B-GPE
Public O
Service O
workers O
thinking O

Oh O
shit O
Im O
about O
to O
be O
told O

Rob B-PER
Ford I-PER
for O

Lol O

I O
will O
be O
voting O
for O
the O
first O
person O
that O
runs O
their O
campaign O
by O
telling O
me O
why O
I O
SHOULD O
vote O
for O
them O
, O
rather O
than O
simply O
slagging O
the O
opposition O
off O
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
hold O
out O
much O
hope O
. O

But O
haven O
' O
t O
politicians O
tried O
this O
before O
? O

Vote O
for O
me O
because O
I O
will O
do O
this O
and O
do O
that O
etc O
etc O
and O
then O
get O
elected O
and O
break O
all O
these O
promises O
. O

Even O
when O
they O
can O
vote O
on O
something O
they O
promised O
you O
if O
the O
Party O
thinks O
its O
a O
bad O
idea O
then O
they O
whip O
the O
vote O
along O
party O
lines O
a O
la O
gun O
registry O
reform O
a O
few O
years O
ago O
. O

Currently O
IMHO O
voters O
are O
showing O
apathy O
during O
various O
elections O
as O
they O
simply O
believe O
politicians O
of O
all O
stripes O
cannot O
be O
trusted O
which O
of O
course O
is O
not O
true O
. O

You O
can O
run O
with O
the O
best O
intentions O
and O
if O
you O
don O
' O
t O
give O
what O
the O
voters O
want O
in O
their O
opinion O
then O
you O
have O
failed O
. O

How O
many O
think O
when O
the O
gun O
registry O
was O
introduced O
that O
it O
was O
a O
good O
idea O
. O

How O
many O
elected O
officials O
voted O
in O
favour O
of O
it O
when O
clearly O
their O
constituents O
wanted O
them O
to O
vote O
against O
it O
. O

I O
' O
m O
voting O
Green B-ORG

the O

I O
just O
look O
at O
the O

and O
every O
year O
it O
seems O
like O
their O
talking O
points O

tactics O
are O
getting O
more O
stoopider O
and O
juvenile O
. O

The O
level O
of O

depressingly O
low O

If O

We O

I O
only O

the O
rest O

it O

I O

and O
the O
packers O
forgot O
to O
mark O
which O
boxes O
they O
packed O
them O

so O
customs B-ORG
opened O
about O
80 O
% O
of O
my O

to O

them O
and O
never O
confiscated O
the O

Just O
rang O

apparently O
it O

no O

The O
same O
with O
food O

they O
often O
argue O
no O
food O
can O
be O
imported O
- O
its O
simply O
because O
its O
easier O
for O
them O
. O

The O
batteries O
may O
need O
to O
be O
declared O
, O
that O
' O
s O
all O
, O
and O
it O
means O
the O
company O
just O
has O
to O
take O
more O
care O

up O

no O

150K O

Another O
way O
we O
used O
to O
get O
around O
it O
was O
to O
have O
items O
shipped O
to O
Algarve B-FAC
Freight I-FAC
depot I-FAC
in O
the O
UK B-GPE
. O

They O
will O
pay O
any O
import O
taxes O
due O
and O
ship O
it O
onwards O
to O
Portugal B-GPE
. O

You O
pay O
taxes O
with O
the O
delivery O
charge O
on O
collection O
. O

We O
did O
that O
a O
few O
times O
also O
. O

It O
would O
always O
work O
out O
far O
cheaper O
and O
quicker O
than O
trying O
to O
deal O
with O
Portuguese B-ORG
customs I-ORG
. O

Trying O
to O
import O
anything O
into O
Portugal B-GPE
from O
overseas O
is O
a O
total O
Rip O
Off O

Alfandiga B-ORG
( O

damn O
well O

The O
only O
free O
trade O
within O
Europe B-LOC
is O
between O
EU B-GPE
members O
imports O
from O
anywhere O
else O
can O
attract O
tax O
. O

Portugal B-GPE
is O
not O
doing O
anything O
different O
to O
the O
UK B-GPE
. O

Many O
people O
in O
the O
UK B-GPE
get O
a O
shock O
when O
buying O
off O
Ebay B-ORG
or O
Amazon B-ORG
when O
they O
get O
a O
bill O
because O
the O
product O
has O
come O
from O
outside O
of O
the O
EU B-GPE
. O

That O
is O
why O
you O
should O
carefully O
check O
where O
you O
are O
buying O
from O
. O

I O
' O
m O
not O
sure O
what O
the O
limit O
is O
; O
usually O
it O
' O
s O
a O
few O
hundred O
euros O
, O
+ O
a O
certain O
amount O
worth O
of O
cigarettes O
and O
a O
certain O
amount O
for O
booze O
. O

But O
that O
only O
applies O
when O
you O
travel O
. O

For O
mail O
order O
items O
, O
you O
[ O
theoretically O
] O
have O
to O
pay O
duty O
from O
the O
first O
euro O
. O

It O
practice O
, O
they O
let O
a O
lot O
slide O
through O
, O
especially O
smaller O
parcels O
. O

But O
I O
' O
ve O
learned O
to O
order O
only O
from O
within O
the O
EU B-GPE
if O
at O
all O
possible O
. O

Things O
from O
outside O
the O
EU B-GPE
can O
get O
stuck O
in O
the O
customs B-ORG
queue O
for O
weeks O
or O
months O
. O

Then O
you O
have O
to O
pay O
duty O
+ O
IVA O
on O
the O
item O
+ O
duty O
+ O
shipping O
. O

It O
just O
takes O
all O
the O
fun O
away O
. O

It O
' O
s O
not O
worth O
sending O
anything O
to O
Portugal B-GPE
from O
outside O
the O
EU B-GPE
. O

It O
sits O
forever O
in O
customs B-FAC
and O
they O
make O
up O
the O
duty O
and O
iva O
as O
they O
feel O
fit O
. O

If O
you O
can O
have O
it O
send O
to O
another O
EU B-GPE
country O
and O
pay O
the O
extra O
postage O
and O
get O
it O
before O
you O
die O
. O

I O
have O
a O

sitting O

lost O
their O
two O

Super O

We O

this O

Coach O
Gary B-PER

He O

the O

make O

We O

I O
' O
m O
still O
really O
pissed O
about O
what O
the O

did O
to O
Tebow B-PER

Every O
time O
I O
read O
an O
article O
it O
was O
some O
leftist O
hack B-PER
trashing O
Tebow B-PER
for O
being O
Christian O
. O

I O
don O
’ O
t O
think O
the O
NFL B-ORG
would O
let O
a O
team O
sign O
Tebow B-PER
. O

They O
are O
more O
interested O
in O
players O
with O
the O
character O
of O
Manziel B-PER

the O

Elway B-PER
hates O
Tebow B-PER

It O
won O
’ O
t O
happen O
. O

Ah O
if O
he O
only O
had O
the O
talent O
to O
play O
at O
the O
pro O
level O

But O
the O
author B-PER
didn O
' O
t O
specify O
that O
so O
maybe O
he O
doesn O
' O
t O
think O
it O
' O

necessary O
? O

Tebow B-PER
puts O
Elway B-PER

conviction O

he O
might O
run O

a O
Florida B-GPE

trying O
to O

anyone O
here O

Tebow B-PER
maybe O
should O
have O
tried O
another O
position O

He O
was O
a O
gifted O
athlete B-PER

NOT O
an O
NFL B-ORG
calber O

He O
could O
run O

people O

couldn O
' O
t O
throw O
consistently O

When O
he O

I O

I O
suspected O

simply O
true O

Love O
the O
guy B-PER

I O
don O
' O
t O

he O
was O
black O
balled O

he O
was O
a O
Christian O

That O
ship O
has O
sailed O

Let O
it O

Turns O
out O
Manning B-PER
was O
a O
good O
decision O
on O
Elway B-PER
’ O
s O
part O
, O
but O
he O
sent O
Tebow B-PER
out O
with O
a O
bad O
referral O
to O
other O
teams O

I O
still O
cannot O
account O
for O
that O

the O
talent O

He O
played O
well O
enough O
to O
get O
a O
win O
in O
the O
playoffs O

The O
better O
than O
vast O
majority O
of O
Pro O
QBs O

Tebow B-PER
was O
a O
decent O
ball O
control O
QB B-PER
that O
could O
win O
games O
with O
a O
strong O
defense O
and O
he O
certainly O
played O
better O
than O
Manning B-PER
did O
last O
year O
. O

Tebow B-PER
’ O
s O
primary O
problem O
is O
he O
’ O
s O
just O
not O
smart O
enough O
to O
be O
a O
pro O
level O
QB O
and O
lead O
a O
team O
effectively O

He O
’ O

Elway B-PER

A O

was O
carefully O
selected O

along O
with O
a O
target B-FAC

Nairobi B-GPE
’ O

gleaming O
Westgate B-FAC
mall I-FAC
. O

The O
building B-FAC
’ O

blueprints O
were O
studied O
, O
down O
to O
the O
ventilation O

. O

The O
attack O
was O
rehearsed O
and O
the O
team O
dispatched O
, O
slipping O
undetected O
through O
Kenya B-GPE
’ O

porous O

, O
often O
patrolled O
by O

deeply O

A O
day O
or O
two O
before O
the O

, O
powerful O

were O
secretly O

in O
the O

with O
the O
help O
of O
a O
colluding O
employee B-PER
, O
officials O
say O
. O

At O
least O
one O
militant B-PER
had O
packed O
a O
change O
of O
clothes O
so O
he O
could O
slip O
out O
with O
fleeing O
civilians O
after O
the O
killings O
were O
done O
. O

That O
is O
the O
picture O
emerging O
from O
American B-GPE
security O
officials O
of O
the O
massacre O
at O
the O
Westgate B-FAC
mall I-FAC
, O
which O
killed O
scores O
of O

over O

After O
a O
four O
- O
day O
standoff O
, O
President O
Uhuru B-PER
Kenyatta I-PER
of O
Kenya B-GPE
claimed O
Tuesday O
to O
have O
finally O
“ O
ashamed O
and O
defeated O
our O
attackers O
, O
” O
declaring O
that O
the O
last O
militants O
still O
holed O
up O
inside O
the O

had O
been O
killed O
, O
though O
the O
bodies O
of O
many O
civilians O
, O
perhaps O
dozens O
, O
have O
yet O
to O
be O
recovered O
. O

Kenyatta B-PER
contended O
that O
“ O
intelligence O
reports O
had O
suggested O
that O
a O
British B-GPE
woman B-PER
and O
two O
or O
three O
American B-GPE
citizens O
may O
have O
been O
involved O
, O
” O
but O
said O
that O
he O
could O
not O
confirm O
those O
reports O
. O

American B-GPE
officials O
said O
that O
they O
had O
not O
determined O
the O
identities O
of O
the O
attackers O
and O
were O
awaiting O
DNA O
tests O
and O
footage O
from O
the O
mall B-FAC
’ O

, O
but O
that O
they O
did O
know O
the O
massacre O
was O
meticulously O
planned O
to O
draw O
“ O
maximum O
exposure O
. O
” O

“ O
They O
had O
people O
in O
there B-FAC
, O
they O
had O
stuff O
inside O
there B-FAC
, O
” O
said O
an O
American B-GPE
security O
official B-PER
who O
asked O
not O
to O
be O
identified O
because O
he O
was O
not O
authorized O
to O
speak O
publicly O
. O

“ O
This O
was O
all O
ready O
to O
go O
when O
the O
shooters O
walked O
in O

one O
of O

The O

an O

of O
peace O

prosperity O
in O
a O
troubled O

are O
struggling O
to O
answer O
how O
10 O
to O
15 O
Islamist O

could O
lay O
siege O
to O
a O
shopping O
mall B-FAC
, O
killing O
more O
than O
60 O
civilians O
with O
military O

weaponry O
, O
then O
hold O
off O
Kenyan B-GPE
security O
forces O
for O
days O
. O

Western B-LOC
security O
officials O
fear O
that O
several O
fighters O
slipped O
out O
of O
the O
mall B-FAC
during O
the O
mayhem O
of O
the O
attack O
, O
dropping O
their O

and O
disguising O
themselves O
as O
civilians O
, O
an O
account O
echoed O
by O
some O
witnesses O

And O
there O
could O
be O
more O

an O
excess O

focus O

turning O
as O
how O
such O

could O
go O
into O
a O
corner O
with O
a O
speed O
limit O

Spanish B-GPE
TV O
and O
posted O
on O
virtually O
every O
news O
website O
in O
the O
country B-GPE
shows O
in O
graphic O
detail O
how O
the O
carriages O
are O
hurled O
off O
the O
tracks O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
excessive O
speed O
, O
with O
the O
second O
wagon O
appearing O
to O
jump O
the O
tracks O
while O
those O
behind O
it O
are O
twisted O
into O
tortured O
shapes O
by O
the O
stress O
placed O
upon O
them O
. O

The O
driver B-PER
of O
the O
engine O
is O
the O
first O
suspect B-PER
: O
he O
reportedly O
admitted O
almost O
directly O
after O
the O
accident O
of O
traveling O
at O
190km O
/ O
h O
. O

A O
veteran B-PER
of O
over O
30 O
years O
' O
service O
, O
his O
Facebook O
page O
has O
shown O
that O
he O
had O
previously O
made O
jokes O
about O
breaking O
the O
speed O
limit O
, O
and O
although O
that O
cannot O
be O
taken O
as O
proof O
that O
he O
habitually O
acted O
in O
such O
a O
way O
, O
it O
is O
worrying O
. O

The O
driver B-PER
gave O
negative O
in O
a O
test O
for O
alcohol O
and O
is O
currently O
under O
police O
supervision O
in O
his O
hospital B-FAC
bed O
after O
being O
imputed O
to O
give O
evidence O
to O
the O
judge B-PER
behind O
one O
of O
the O
two O
investigations O
into O
the O
tragedy O
. O

The O
judge B-PER
is O
in O
possession O
of O
the O
black O
box O
which O
contains O
recordings O
of O
all O
of O
the O
cabin O
information O
and O
will O
be O
able O
to O
interrogate O
him O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
contents O
of O
that O
fateful O
device O
. O

But O
even O
if O
the O
driver B-PER
was O
speeding O
, O
the O
question O
as O
to O
why O
no O
automatic O
system O
kicked O
in O
to O
automatically O
slow O
the O
train O
down O
. O

The O
engine O
in O
question O
, O
an O
Alvia O
s O
- O
730 O
, O
was O
a O
new O
model O
with O
a O
top O
speed O
of O
250 O
km O
/ O
h O
and O
was O
operating O
on O
track O
which O
had O
recently O
been O
laid O
in O
order O
to O
accommodate O
the O
300km O
/ O
h O
AVE O
high O
speed O
train O
. O

However O
, O
the O
area B-LOC
where O
the O
accident O
happened O
is O
transition O
zone B-LOC
between O
the O
high O
- O
speed O
line B-FAC
and O
a O
conventional O
line B-FAC
. O

The O
high O
- O
speed O
line B-FAC
is O
protected O
with O
the O
ERMTS O
system O
, O
which O
is O
a O
European B-LOC
safety O
system O
designed O
for O
trains O
able O
to O
travel O
at O
speeds O
of O
300km O
/ O
h O
, O
to O
the O
ASFA O
- O
200 O
system O
, O
more O
generally O
used O
on O
lines O
with O
a O
top O
speed O
of O
200 O
km O
/ O
h O
. O

Both O
systems O
are O
assured O
to O
be O
equally O
safe O
and O
are O
intended O
to O
transmit O
an O
action O
protocol O
to O
the O
cabin O
in O
function O
of O
the O
data O
collected O
by O
sensors O
and O
antenna O
installed O
along O
the O
track O
. O

Should O
the O
driver O
ignore O
the O
signals O
they O
are O
programmed O
to O
automatically O
brake O
the O
train O
and O
slow O
it O
down O
, O
something O
that O
failed O
to O
happen O
in O
Wednesday O
' O
s O
disaster O
. O

Investigators O
now O
have O
the O
task O
of O
determining O
why O
on O
a O
piece O
of O
track O
which O
has O
being O
described O
as O
being O
in O
" O
perfect O
conditions O
, O
" O
something O
apparently O
went O
badly O
wrong O
, O
for O
while O
it O
may O
well O
be O
that O
the O
driver B-PER
was O
pushing O
the O
train O
beyond O
the O
limit O
in O
order O
to O
make O
up O
a O
slight O
delay O
on O
arrival O
time O
the O
fact O
is O
that O
the O
automatic O
system O
should O
still O
have O
prevented O
the O
tragedy O

The O
riddle O

Brexit O
consequences O
? O

It O
is O
well O
known O
that O
UK B-GPE
has O
a O
referendum O
planned O
for O
23 O
June O
2016 O
to O
determine O
whether O
to O
stay O
in O
EU B-GPE
or O
exit O
( O
Brexit O
) O
. O

The O
UK B-GPE
media O
is O
full O
of O
info O
but O
not O
much O
debate O
from O
expats O
. O
. O
. O
. O
except O
those O
living O
in O
EU B-GPE
. O

There O
are O
estimated O
between O
1 O
- O
2 O
million O
UK B-GPE
expats O
living O
around O
the O
EU B-GPE
countries O
and O
I O
just O
read O
a O
number O
have O
legally O
challenged O
the O
UK B-GPE
Gov B-ORG
' I-ORG
t I-ORG
as O
they O
have O
been O
excluded O
from O
the O

vote O
. O

Apparently O
the O
law O
states O
if O
non O
- O
resident O
UK B-GPE
for O
over O
15 O
years O
a O
UK B-GPE
citizen O
loses O
his O

I O

the O
date O
for O

' O

heard O
anything O
about O
the O

of O
this O
ruling O
. O
. O
. O
and O
how O
UK B-GPE
, O
after O

will O
deal O
with O
perhaps O
millions O

their O

if O
they O
are O
treated O
similarly O
to O
non O
- O
EU B-GPE

If O

EU B-GPE
it O
is O
likely O
the O
pound O
will O
devalue O
significantly O
. O
. O
and O
so O
will O
the O
value O
of O

this O

Any O

Doesn O
' O
t O
sound O

anyone O
' O

too O
worried O
about O
it O
: O
- O
) O

We O
' O
re O
not O
receiving O
a O
pension O
from O
the O
UK B-GPE
so O
no O
thoughts O
on O
that O
. O

We O
have O
sometimes O
considered O
that O
when O
we O
' O
re O
ready O
to O
settle O
down O
, O
we O
might O
want O
to O
go O
to O
South B-LOC
of I-LOC
France I-LOC
or O
Greece B-GPE

Should O
UK B-GPE
leave O
the O

this O
will O
no O

be O
so O
easy O

Anyway O
, O
I O
refuse O

Thanks O
Fenella B-PER

. O
. O
I O
agree O
the O
Brits B-GPE
( O
at O
least O
the O
media O
) O
seem O
more O
concerned O
that O
Obama B-PER
has O
the O
audacity O
to O
mention O
the O
issue O
than O
deal O
with O
the O
issue O
. O

Boris B-PER
Johnson I-PER
knows O
how O
to O
stir O
the O
ploretariat O
. O
. O
. O
much O
like O
Stalin B-PER
and O
Hitler B-PER
. O

Trump B-PER
applies O
the O
same O
type O
nationalism O
rhetoric O
in O
the O
USA B-GPE
Primaries O
. O

Anyone O
notice O
that O
Donald B-PER
and O
Boris B-PER
are O
look O
- O
alikes O
! O

Strangely O
, O
Boris B-PER
was O
born O
in O
Manhatten B-LOC
as O
was O
Donald B-PER
. O

If O
Trump B-PER
becomes O
President O
he O
has O
vowed O
USA B-GPE
will O
become O
Great O
America B-GPE
. O

If O
Johnson B-PER
leads O
UK B-GPE
to O
Brexit O
, O
and O
the O
consequent O
dissolution O
when O
Scotland B-GPE
leaves O
, O
there O
will O
be O
no O
Great B-LOC
Britain I-LOC
. O
. O
. O

If O
I O
were O
a O
UK B-GPE
expat O
living O
a O
retired O
life O
in O
EU B-GPE
I O
' O
d O
be O
very O
worried O
. O
. O
. O
in O
fact O
, O
I O
' O
d O
consider O
returning O
and O
claiming O
all O
benefits O
like O
NHS O
and O
welfare O
etc O
. O

If O
millions O
of O
expats O
did O
that O
. O
. O
. O
the O
UK B-GPE
economy O
would O
bankrupt O

of O

Deathly O

the O

so O
far O

, O
even O
here B-GPE
in O
Bali B-GPE
, O
I O
can O
hear O
the O
sucking O
of O
false O
teeth O
as O
my O
question O
is O
germinating O
thought O
. O
. O
. O

I O
do O
still O
believe O
that O
Boris B-PER
is O
the O
lesser O
of O
two O
evils O

The O
problem O
is O
the O
whole O
the O
whole O
" O
Great O
" O
in O
" O
Great B-LOC
Britain I-LOC
" O
. O

Too O
many O
Brits B-GPE
still O
believe O
this O
is O
the O
case O
and O
that O
' O
s O
why O
they O
' O
ll O
be O
much O
better O
off O
out O
of O
the O
EU B-GPE
. O

The O
days O
of O
the O
great O
British B-GPE
Empire I-GPE
are O
long O
gone O
but O
not O
everyone O
sees O
it O
. O

Although O
I O
don O
' O
t O
follow O
things O
closely O
anymore O
I O
can O
' O
t O
understand O
why O
Scotland B-GPE
will O
ever O
again O
even O
think O
about O
leaving O
the O
UK B-GPE
. O

Shirley O
after O
the O
plunge O
in O
oil O
prices O
Scotland B-GPE
' O
s O
economy O
would O
have O
nose O
dived O
to O
zilch O
if O
the O
Scots B-GPE
had O
voted O
to O
leave O
the O
UK B-GPE
last O
time O
. O

They O
would O
then O
have O
had O
to O
get O
out O
the O
begging O
bowl O
to O
Westminster B-GPE

I O
suggest O
searching O
anything O
about O
Scotland B-GPE
leaving O
UK B-GPE
, O
if O
UK B-GPE
leaves O

a O

summing O
up O
both O

Few O
had O
initially O
predicted O

except O
, O
perhaps O
, O
the O
candidate B-PER
himself O

In O
high O

he O
was O
known O
by O
a O
nickname O
, O
Senator B-PER
Provolone I-PER

his O

sometimes O
hummed O
“ O

when O
he O
entered O
the O

But O
throughout O
his O
life O
, O
de B-PER
Blasio I-PER
had O
come O
to O
delight O
in O
upsetting O

He O
overcame O
a O
troubled O
childhood O
and O
attended O
some O
of O
the O

Chirlane B-PER

He O
cut O
his O

as O
a O
political O

abandoned O

I O
won O
' O
t O
stop O
buying O
Apple B-ORG
products O
because O
of O
it O
. O

If O
they O
were O
grinding O
small O
children O
up O
to O
make O
the O
casings O
or O
whatever O
, O
then O
, O
yes O
, O
maybe O
I O
' O
d O
care O
, O
but O
, O
as O
it O
stands O
, O
nothing O
I O
do O
will O
stop O
those O
workers O
from O
being O
abused O
by O
that O
company B-ORG
. O

If O
I O
stop O
buying O
Apple B-ORG
and O
buy O
some O
other O
supplier O
' O
s O
system O
, O
then O
I O
have O
no O
proof O
whatsoever O
that O
such O
a O
purchase O
will O
in O
any O
way O
reduce O
any O
sort O
of O
labor O
abuse O
. O

To O
think O
that O
not O
buying O
Apple B-ORG
products O
will O
( O
a O
) O
alter O
Apple B-ORG
' O
s O
opinion O
at O
all O
and O
/ O
or O
( O
b O
) O
will O
in O
any O
way O
positively O
affect O
those O
workers O
is O
wishful O
thinking O
. O

Actually O
, O
there O
' O
s O
a O
really O
interesting O
article O
in O
the O
Guardian O
last O
Saturday O
which O
proposes O
that O
Chinese B-GPE
labourers O
actually O
have O
better O
labour O
rights O
than O
British B-GPE
workers O
! O
! O

I O
would O
stop O
buying O
Apple B-ORG
products O
if O
nothing O
changes O
. O

Globalization O
is O
bad O
. O
. O
. O

Ummm O
. O
. O
. O
OK O
. O
You O
realize O
of O
course O
that O
almost O
every O
electronic O
device O
you O
own O
has O
Foxconn B-ORG
components O
inside O
it O
? O

That O
' O
ll O
include O
your O
TV O
, O
your O
clock O
- O
radio O
, O
your O
microwave O
, O
certainly O
your O
car O
and O
possibly O
your O
washing O
machine O
as O
well O
. O

Generally O
, O
wherever O
a O
cable O
plugs O
into O
a O
socket O
, O
the O
likelihood O
is O
that O
Foxconn B-ORG
made O
the O
socket O
. O

Look O
at O
the O
label O
on O
the O
inside O
collar O
of O
your O
shirt O
- O
it O
will O
say O
Malaysia B-GPE
, O
Vietnam B-GPE
or O
China B-GPE
. O
. O
. O
made O
under O
the O
same O
or O
worse O
factory O
conditions O
. O

Even O
if O
you O
choose O
sustainable O
forest O
lumber O
from O
North B-LOC
America I-LOC
, O
the O
nails O
you O
use O
to O
build O
your O
house O
out O
of O
likely O
came O
from O
China B-GPE
. O

Unless O
you O
want O
to O
return O
to O
horse O
- O
drawn O
transport O
and O
barter O
locally O
for O
your O
food O
and O
clothes O
, O
you O
may O
want O
to O
reconsider O
. O

A O
rather O
vague O
and O
emotive O
way O
of O
putting O
it O
. O

Apple B-ORG
doesn O
' O
t O
own O
any O
of O
its O
factories O
in O
China B-GPE
, O
it O
sub O
- O
contracts O
to O
them O
. O

The O
allegations O
made O
in O
the O
press O
have O
been O
that O
Apple B-ORG
have O
been O
using O
sub O
- O
contractors O
who O
under O
- O
pay O
and O
over O
- O
work O
their O
employers O
. O

These O
sub O
- O
contractors O
also O
are O
also O
used O
by O
other O
electronics O
companies O
. O

A O
subtle O
difference O
but O
an O
important O
one O
. O

This O
does O
not O
excuse O
Apple B-ORG
from O
taking O
any O
action O
if O
it O
hears O
of O
any O
unethical O
practice O
by O
any O
of O
its O
sub O
- O
contractors O
however O
. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
think O
that O
Apple B-ORG
would O
take O
action O
agaist O
any O
contractors O
that O
abuse O
human O
rights O
. O

Remember O
that O
Foxconn B-ORG
isnt O
just O
based O
in O
China B-GPE
- O
it O
also O
has O
a O
factory B-FAC
in O
Czech B-GPE
republis I-GPE
, O
where O

are O

A O
good O
thing O
to O
put O

is O
XBMC O
( O

It O

You O
can O

I O
' O
m O
making O

I O
have O
run O
XBMC O
for O
a O
long O
time O
, O
so O
it O
made O
sense O
to O
put O

it O

Can O
you O

a O
good O

Sorry O
I O
cannot O
, O
I O

Though O
I O
did O

I O
might O
be O

a O

Should O
i O
get O
a O
regular O
Ubuntu O

go O
with O

What O
do O
you O
use O
for O
media O
storage O
with O

? O

I O
would O
like O
to O
have O
a O
huge O

stored O
on O
a O

ideally O
( O
either O
connected O
or O
on O

. O

The O
only O
other O
thing O
i O
would O
likely O
like O
to O
use O
it O
for O
is O
MAME O
, O
but O
then O
i O
see O
the O

feature O
in O

is O
going O
to O
support O
MAME O

and O
others O

Some O
other O
questions O

Is O
it O
possible O
to O
use O
a O
game O
controller O
? O

Does O
XBMC O
have O
some O
kind O
of O
remote O
control O
or O
does O
it O
need O
the O

Strange O
how O
' O
Ordinary O
' O
Muslims O
say O
they O
are O
not O
the O
same O
as O
the O

yet O
the O
message O
given O
out O
seems O
to O
have O
gone O
out O
to O
all O

the O

to O
insult O

no O

in O

I O

a O

up O

I O
can O

If O
it O

why O

1 O
. O

How O

should O
we O
budget O
to O
spend O
per O
month O
for O
when O
we O
retire O
to O
the O
algarve B-LOC

For O

lifestyle O

portugal B-GPE
? O

ideas O

Many O
thanks O

See O

Cars O
coming O
from O
Dubai B-GPE
could O
be O
complicated O
, O
you O
" O
may O
" O
be O
able O
to O
import O
them O
and O
avoid O
the O
" O
imposto O
automovel O
" O
tax O
( O
can O
be O
done O
with O
cars O
that O
came O
within O
EU B-GPE
and O
Switzerland B-GPE
) O

Certicate O
of O
conformity O
could O
also O
be O
a O
problem O
. O

I O
would O
forget O
it O
to O
be O
honest O
and O
buy O
here B-GPE
. O

Thats O
what O
i O
thought O
, O
thanks O
very O
much O
for O
the O
quick O
reply O

I O
wrote O
a O
big O
article O
about O

I O
hope O

me O
posting O
it O
as O
I O
think O

will O
help O
you O
. O

I O
just O
scanned O
through O
it O
and O
it O
' O
s O
all O
still O
valid O
, O
but O
I O
would O
say O
our O
gas O
and O
water O
costs O
have O
crept O
up O
in O
the O
last O
year O
( O
water O
is O
now O
hitting O
€ O
50 O
/ O
month O
and O
it O
' O
s O
not O
like O
we O
' O
re O
using O
more O
) O
. O

PS O
. O

I O
agree O
with O
Ged B-PER
about O
the O
cars O
- O
just O
buy O
here B-GPE
and O
avoid O
the O
heartache O
! O

Thats O
brilliant O
thanks O

and O
i O
have O
just O
ordered O
your O

Hi O
allylulu B-PER
, O

Just O
thought O
I O
drop O
a O
note O
here O
because O
you O
two O
appear O
to O
be O
in O
a O
similar O
situation O
as O
my O
wife B-PER
and O
I O
. O

We O
have O
lived O
in O
DXB B-GPE
for O
the O
past O
ten O
years O
and O
have O
decided O
' O
enough O
is O
enough O
' O
and O
plan O
to O
retire O
to O
Portugal B-GPE
– O
target O
May O
2015 O
, O
although O
we O
are O
heading O
to O
the O
Silver B-LOC
Coast I-LOC
. O

As O
for O
cost O
of O
living O
you O
may O
find O
this O
site O
useful O
. O

Not O
sure O
if O
you O
have O
explored O
the O
tax O
benefits O
of O
applying O
for O
the O
Non O
Habitual O
Resident O
scheme O
, O
maybe O
worth O
getting O
in O
contact O
with O
a O
good O
tax O
advisor O
over O
there B-GPE
. O

We O
used O
PWC B-ORG
. O

Initially O
we O
were O
apprehensive O
about O
taking O
our O
car O
across O
, O
but O
after O
finding O
out O
that O
the O
same O
model O
we O
have O
here B-GPE
will O
cost O
a O
staggering O
15K O
Euros O
more O
in O
Portugal B-GPE
, O
we O
did O
some O
further O
research O
and O
made O
some O
inquiries O
. O

The O
result O
is O
there O
are O
companies O
and O
people O
who O
will O
handle O
all O
of O
the O
paperwork O
for O
your O
, O
for O
a O
price O
, O
( O
but O
not O
15K O
Euros O
) O
. O

Non O
- O
European B-LOC
cars O
will O
not O
have O
a O
Certificate O
of O
Conformity O
, O
but O
you O
can O
get O
the O
car O
certified O
by O
companies O
like O

There O
are O
many O
examples O
of O
people O
importing O
cars O
from O
Canada B-GPE
and O
US B-GPE
, O
which O
do O
not O
have O
CoC O
. O

Anyhow O
, O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
worth O
sharing O
experiences O
with O
you O
. O

Good O
luck O
