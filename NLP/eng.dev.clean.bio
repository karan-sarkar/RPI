Seeing O
that O
there O

some O

today O
, O
thanks O
Enigma B-PER

I O
have O
read O
so O
many O
posts O
on O
bugging O
in O
/ O
bugging O
out O
, O
large O
groups O
/ O
small O
groups O
, O
urban O
options O
/ O
rural O
options O
, O
big O
guns O
/ O
little O
guns O
, O
shelters O
, O
food O
storage O
and O
so O
much O
more O
. O

Something O
missing O
for O
me O
, O
perhaps O
I O
have O
overlooked O
the O
thread O
? O

I O
would O
love O
to O
hear O
some O
of O
your O
guys O
and O
gals O
opinions O
on O
crossing O
the O
border O
to O
Namibia B-GPE
/ O
Mozambique B-GPE
/ O
Botswana B-GPE
? O

Pros O
or O
Cons O
? O

Great O
thread O
! O

It O
opens O
up O
a O
whole O
new O
dimension O
of O
possibilities O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
travelled O
and O
lived O
in O
Europe B-LOC
and O
Asia B-LOC
, O
but O
never O
in O
the O
rest O
of O
Africa B-LOC
! O

Always O
been O
a O
dream O
to O
do O
that O
one O
day O
when O
I O
' O
m O
at O
retirement O
age O
. O

So O
I O
am O
not O
really O
qualified O
to O
answer O
your O
question O
, O
since O
I O
have O
not O
lived O
in O
the O
countries O
you O
mentioned O
, O
but O
if O
I O
' O
d O
venture O
an O
educated O
guess O
, O
I O
' O
d O
say O
it O
will O
be O
safer O
to O
cross O
over O
into O
Namibia B-GPE
or O
Botswana B-GPE
, O
depending O
where O
you O
are O
currently O
located O
in O
SA B-GPE
. O

I O
think O
it O
depens O
on O
the O
level O
of O
poverty O
in O
the O
countries O
mentioned O
, O
land O
issues O
there O
and O
biased O
political O
affiliations O
that O
their O
governments O
have O
with O
SA B-GPE
government O
. O

Mozambique B-GPE
, O
is O
still O
too O
unstable O
, O
with O
Renamo B-ORG
flare O
- O
ups O
, O
so O
influx O
of O
people O
over O
the O
border O
, O
will O
cause O
resentment O
amongst O
locals O
. O

Also O
, O
you O
can O
' O
t O
own O
land O
in O
Moz B-GPE
if O
u O
not O
a O
citizen O
, O
you O
have O
to O
lease O
, O
if O
I O
am O
not O
mistaken O
( O
I O
stand O
to O
be O
corrected O
) O
. O

Botswana B-GPE
has O
lots O
of O
empty O
spaces O
, O
so O
may O
be O
a O
good O
option O
, O
plus O
one O
of O
the O
safest O
countries O
in O
africa B-LOC
I O
think O
( O
I O
stand O
to O
be O
corrected O
) O

Namibia B-GPE
may O
be O
a O
good O
option O
, O
as O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
stable O
, O
but O
there O
was O
recent O
land O
claim O
issues O
or O
something O
to O
that O
affect O
, O
a O
while O
ago O
, O
so O
resentment O
brewing O
there O
. O

Land O
reform O
is O
implemented O
there O
, O
similar O
to O
SA B-GPE
. O

Not O
sure O
about O
land O
ownership O
, O
but O
think O
its O
allowed O
. O

So O
I O
think O
my O
choice O
will O
be O
Botswana B-GPE

If O
the O
SHTF O
in O
a O
big O
way O
in O
SA B-GPE
, O
and O
if O
it O
is O
a O
quick O
( O
almost O
overnight O
) O
descent O
into O
chaos O
. O
. O
. O
then O
I O
suspect O
that O
many O
of O
out O
neighbours O
would O
simply O
close O
their O
borders O
pretty O
quickly O
. O

None O
of O
them O
, O
that O
I O
am O
aware O
of O
, O
are O
equipped O
to O
handle O
an O
influx O
of O
refugees O
on O
the O
sort O
of O
scale O
that O
I O
suspect O
would O
happen O
( O
millions O
) O
. O

They O
do O
not O
have O
the O
money O
nor O
the O
infrastructure O
to O
accommodate O
those O
refugees O
. O

I O
also O
suspect O
that O
Zim B-GPE
would O
not O
want O
their O
" O
runners O
" O
heading O
back O
to O
their O
own O
country O
either O
. O

Yip O
I O
think O
Nunu O
is O
right O
. O

If O
its O
an O
overnight O
shtf O
situation O
, O
those O
countries O
will O
most O
probably O
close O
borders O
. O

If O
there O
is O
advanced O
warning O
however O
, O
it O
may O
be O
worthwhile O
for O
some O
people O
who O
are O
planning O
to O
bug O
out O
and O
who O
currently O
live O
in O
close O
proximity O
to O
these O
borders O
, O
to O
establish O
a O
nice O
secondary O
hidden O
Bol O
, O
just O
over O
the O
fence O
so O
to O
speak O
, O
just O
in O
case O
its O
needed O
. O

In O
a O
race O
- O
based O
civil O
war O
, O
do O
you O
mean O
? O

I O
decided O
a O
long O
time O
ago O
that O
that O
would O
not O
be O
an O
option O
for O
me O
because O
in O
a O
full O
- O
scale O
conflagration O
the O
ANC B-ORG
' O
s O
historical O
blood O
brothers O
would O
be O
very O
quick O
to O
side O
with O
them O
against O
their O
( O
mutual O
) O
historical O
foes O
. O

On O
a O
few O
occasions O
I O
have O
been O
in O
ANC B-ORG
company O
in O
Botswana B-GPE
, O
Angola B-GPE
, O
and O
elsewhere O
, O
and O
I O
have O
been O
struck O
by O
just O
how O
deep O
the O
bonds O
of O
allegiance O
run O
, O
and O
how O
fresh O
and O
acute O
are O
the O
sentiments O
about O
the O
wars O
of O
liberation O
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
want O
to O
have O
to O
write O
out O
an O
essay O
, O
but O
I O
assure O
you O
that O
it O
is O
not O
beyond O
the O
realms O
of O
reality O
to O
say O
that O
- O
were O
the O
circumstances O
severe O
enough O
- O
Namibia B-GPE
, O
Botswana B-GPE
, O
and O
others O
would O
inter O
white O
South O
Africans O
. O

You O
lose O
your O
guns O
if O
you O
cross O
the O
border O
. O

Thanks O
for O
the O
feedback O
everyone O
. O

With O
regards O
to O
Namibia B-GPE
, O
there O
is O
still O
strong O
German B-GPE
presence O
, O
if O
they O
rejected O
us O
whites O
and O
the O
white O
German B-GPE
influence O
made O
a O
noise O
, O
what O
do O
you O
think O
will O
be O
the O
chances O
of O
Aunty B-PER
Merkel I-PER
and O
clan O
throwing O
in O
a O
wee O
bit O
of O
" O
influence O
" O
? O

You O
should O
read O
the O
SvR B-PER
story O
. O

He O
has O
quite O
a O
bit O
to O
say O
about O
our O
civil O
war O
, O
the O
Germans O
, O
and O
Namibia B-GPE
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
want O
to O
give O
the O
game O
away O
, O
but O
if O
you O
are O
thinking O
along O
those O
lines O
then O
you O
really O
should O
read O
what O
Siener B-PER
has O
to O
say O
about O
your O

topic O
above O
. O

You O

Syria B-GPE
Poll O

Are O
you O
for O
or O
against O
US B-GPE
involvement O
? O

I O
am O
curious O
about O
the O
breakdown O
between O
liberal O
and O
conservative O
as O
I O
think O
this O
is O
one O
of O
those O
topics O
that O
might O
not O
be O
separated O
by O
party O
lines O
. O

Not O
American O
. O

But O
I O
firmly O
believe O
that O
the O
US B-GPE
would O
do O
it O
' O
s O
self O
, O
and O
the O
world O
a O
great O
service O
, O
by O
staying O
out O
of O
Syria B-GPE

The O
use O
of O
chemical O
weapons O

cannot O
go O
unpunished O

I O
fully O
support O

I O
am O
a O

We O
don O
' O

I O
can O

while O
we O
don O
' O
t O
have O
that O

We O
' O
re O
just O
going O

We O

evidence O
do O
you O
have O
that O
the O

Would O
such O

What O
if O
it O

a O
lot O
of O

Who O

Should O

No O

Yes O
. O

What O
if O
it O
doesn O
' O
t O
and O
kills O
exactly O
to O
whom O
the O
strike O
it O
was O
intended O
? O

No O
. O

It O
' O
s O
citizens O
with O
international O
help O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
written O
my O
Congressmen O
and O
hope O
he O
and O
our O
other O
elected O
officials O
decide O
to O
strike O
. O

I O
hope O
your O
Parliament B-ORG
reconvenes O
when O
they O
feel O
they O
have O
sufficient O
evidence O
and O
also O
votes O
to O
authorize O
a O
strike O
. O

I O
chose O
other O
, O
here O
' O
s O
my O
option O
: O

Support O
President O
to O
take O
military O
action O
2 O
years O
ago O
- O
Liberal O

If O
your O
government O
is O
proposing O
to O
kill O
people O
and O
attack O
a O
foreign O
government O
in O
your O
name O
, O
don O
' O
t O
you O
think O
they O
should O
be O
providing O
credible O
evidence O
of O
a O
" O
qualifying O
" O
crime O
? O

Without O
evidence O
, O
you O
have O
no O
idea O
, O
quite O
apart O
from O
the O
inevitable O
collateral O
damage O
. O

That O
would O
indeed O
be O
a O
first O
. O

Why O
not O
? O

What O
, O
like O
they O
do O
in O
Afghanistan B-GPE
, O
Libya B-GPE
and O
Iraq B-GPE
? O

Not O
in O
my O
name O
. O

The O
only O
strike O
I O
would O
support O
is O
one O
against O
the O
" O
rebels O
" O
not O
the O
government O
. O

The O
west B-LOC
is O
proposing O
to O
get O
in O
on O
the O
wrong O
side O
of O
this O
fight O
. O

Fundamentally O
I O
don O
' O
t O
trust O
the O
security O
services O
one O
bit O
. O

If O
they O
want O
their O
evidence O
to O
be O
taken O
seriously O
they O
need O
to O
massively O
improve O
their O
credibility O
. O

Left O
leaning O
independent O
against O
a O
strike O
. O

The O
poll O
options O
suck O
so O
I O
chose O
' O
other O
' O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
seen O
reports O
that O
phone O
calls O
to O
Congress B-ORG
are O
running O
1200 O
- O
1 O
against O
a O
strike O
. O

Ah O
, O
the O
old O
, O
for O
the O
children O
argument O
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
old O
children O
argument O
. O

I O
wouldn O
' O
t O
break O
up O
a O
fight O
between O
two O
adults O
, O
but O
I O
would O
with O
an O
adult O
against O
a O
child O
. O

I O
understand O
my O
opinion O
is O
not O
popular O
. O

Not O
my O
concern O
. O

Most O
fights O
I O
' O
ve O
seen O
between O
adults O
have O
been O
broken O
up O
. O

Lessons O
from O
current O
Conflicts O
Worldwide O

I O
like O
to O
know O
what O
goes O
on O
in O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
, O
as O
whatever O
happens O
worldwide O
, O
do O
also O
have O
an O
affect O
on O
us O
, O
even O
if O
indirectly O
. O

So O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
keeping O
a O
very O
close O
eye O
on O
the O
developments O
in O
Africa B-LOC
, O
Ukraine B-GPE
and O
also O
the O
rapid O
advance O
of O
Isis B-ORG
. O

Its O
horrific O
what O
is O
taking O
place O
not O
only O
in O
N B-GPE

Libya B-GPE
, O
Syria B-GPE
& O
amp O
; O
Iraq B-GPE
, O
but O
also O
in O
Ukraine B-GPE
. O

What O
these O
conflicts O
have O
taught O
me O
thus O
far O
: O

Shtf O
can O
happen O
overnight O
or O
within O
hours O
, O
where O
you O
literally O
have O
to O
run O
for O
your O
life O
with O
only O
the O
clothing O
on O
your O
back O
- O
So O
its O
prudent O
to O
have O
a O
place O
close O
to O
your O
home O
where O
you O
can O
hide O
, O
even O
if O
its O
a O
pre O
- O
dug O
hole O
in O
the O
ground O
, O
a O
mini O
- O
bol O
if O
you O
will O
, O
were O
you O
can O
stay O
for O
a O
short O
while O
, O
cause O
if O
u O
hv O
an O
hour O
or O
less O
to O
get O
out O
of O
dodge O
, O
there O
is O
no O
way O
you O
will O
be O
able O
to O
get O
out O
by O
car O
nor O
will O
you O
get O
very O
far O
on O
foot O
. O

Maybe O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
have O
a O
bug O
out O
bag O
and O
weapons O
stashed O
there O
too O
. O

There O
is O
no O
such O
thing O
as O
a O
friend O
or O
a O
friendly O
neighbor O
- O
When O
shtf O
, O
your O
best O
friend O
or O
nice O
neighbor O
will O
turn O
on O
you O
or O
turn O
you O
in O
. O

- O
Therefore O
imo O
, O
its O
best O
to O
keep O
your O
prepping O
activities O
on O
the O
low O
down O
and O
trust O
nobody O
. O

Cash O
Money O
- O
During O
a O
major O
shtf O
situation O
, O
you O
are O
going O
to O
need O
lots O
of O
cash O
to O
grease O
palms O
to O
buy O
your O
safety O
and O
that O
of O
your O
family O
if O
need O
be O
, O
to O
get O
from O
point O
A O
- O
B O
and O
/ O
or O
to O
pay O
premium O
price O
for O
whatever O
scarce O
items O
are O
available O
. O

- O
Time O
for O
me O
to O
start O
stashing O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
money O
each O
month O
in O
a O
coffee O
tin O
or O
something O
I O
think O
. O

Gold O
and O
silver O
will O
be O
also O
nice O
of O
course O
, O
but O
for O
now O
, O
I O
can O
' O
t O
afford O
to O
buy O
gold O
or O
silver O
, O
so O
money O
will O
have O
to O
do O
. O

Bunkers O
/ O
Basements O
- O
Currently O
in O
Ukraine B-GPE
, O
bunkers O
/ O
basements O
have O
saved O
many O
lives O
. O

Many O
homes O
in O
the O
towns O
which O
were O
/ O
are O
under O
attack O
, O
have O
basements O
. O

Admittedly O
many O
also O
died O
inside O
them O
. O

But O
at O
least O
it O
has O
given O
some O
people O
a O
place O
to O
hide O
, O
even O
if O
its O
only O
temporary O
. O

- O
So O
imo O
a O
bunker O
/ O
basement O
is O
a O
must O

that O

broadens O
the O
mind O
, O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
some O
of O
these O
places O
, O
the O
people O
are O
the O
most O
welcoming O
and O
kind O
around O
, O
despite O
what O
you O
hear O
from O
the O
mainstream O
media O
which O
by O
the O
way O
are O
owned O
by O
corporations O
. O
. O

Just O
wanted O
to O
say O
that O
because O
, O
whenever O
people O
talk O
about O
this O
region O
they O
always O
point O
out O
the O
bad O
and O
never O
the O
good O
, O
and O
I O
find O
it O
disgustingly O
insensitive O
and O
frankly O
rather O
immature O
, O
learn O
some O
empathy O
for O
others O
. O
. O

Their O
government O
obviously O
hasn O
' O
t O
figured O
out O
that O
its O
better O
to O
secretly O
monitor O
what O
everyone O
is O
doing O
on O
the O
internet O
rather O
than O
trying O
block O

be O
awkward O

Every O

Apple B-ORG

Actually O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
it O

Regarding O
the O

comments O
about O
Turkey B-GPE
' O

politics O
: O

Don O
' O
t O
take O
it O
out O
on O
the O
country O
as O
a O
whole O
. O

It O
' O
s O
a O
beautiful O
place O
, O
and O
I O
' O
ve O
met O
many O
very O
smart O
and O
friendly O
people O
there O
who O
are O
extremely O
upset O
and O
frustrated O
about O
the O
current O
situation O
. O

( O
At O
least O
56 O
% O
of O
the O
votes O
were O
not O
for O
the O
ruling O
party O
in O
last O
week O
' O
s O
elections O
, O
possibly O
even O
more O
. O
) O

Besides O
, O
so O
many O
people O
there O
are O
willing O
to O
stand O
up O
for O
their O
rights O
, O
although O
even O
peaceful O
protesters O
are O
being O
violently O
attacked O
by O
the O
police O
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
think O
that O
' O
s O
worthy O
of O
respect O
, O
not O
ridicule O
. O

Their O
current O
government O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
. O
. O
. O
they O
deserve O
all O
the O
ridicule O
and O
disrespect O
you O
can O
muster O
. O

Would O
love O
to O
see O
an O
Apple B-ORG
Store O
in O
Green B-GPE
Bay I-GPE
, O
WI B-GPE
. O

Right O
now O
I O
have O
to O
travel O
2 O
- O
3 O
hours O
to O
get O
to O
a O
Apple B-FAC
Store I-FAC
. O

We O
are O
the O
3rd O
largest O
city O
in O
Wisconsin B-GPE
so O
no O
reason O
we O
shouldn O
' O
t O
have O
one O
. O

Are O
we O
to O
blame O
for O
Bangladesh B-GPE
factory O
collapse O
? O

Seems O
the O
factory O
supplied O
companies O
like O
Primark B-ORG
and O
the O
Spanish B-GPE
firm O
Mango B-ORG
. O

Is O
it O
the O
companies O
fault O
for O
not O
demanding O
safer O
working O
conditions O
in O
their O
suppliers O
. O

Or O
is O
it O
our O
fault O
for O
choosing O
the O
cheaper O
option O
when O
we O
purchase O
? O

It O
has O
everything O
to O
do O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
loads O
of O
factories O
in O
China B-GPE
, O
India B-GPE
etc O
, O
are O
unsafe O
anyway O
, O
and O
have O
multiple O
factories O
crammed O
into O
a O
single O
multistorey O
buildings O
. O

Although O
Primark B-ORG
etc O
do O
make O
money O
by O
using O
these O
sweatshops O
, O
the O
local O
businessmen O
also O
make O
money O
and O
they O
don O
´ O
t O
seem O
to O
care O
about O
the O
safety O
aspect O
of O
the O
local O
workers O
when O
considering O
their O
profits O
. O

Surely O
as O
the O
workers O
were O
not O
employed O
by O
Primark B-ORG
, O
then O
the O
employer O
( O
probably O
local O
) O
should O
be O
held O
responsible O
, O
because O
even O
if O
there O
was O
no O
Primark B-ORG
contract O
the O
building O
would O
still O
have O
been O
used O
to O
make O
cheap O
clothing O
for O
another O
company O
. O

Its O
the O
Builders O
who O
should O
be O
blamed O
. O
. O
not O
the O
factory O
owners O
. O
. O

. O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O
and O
the O
govt O
for O
not O
exercising O
proper O
building O
regulations O
. O

I O
wouldn O
' O
t O
imagine O
for O
one O
moment O
that O
those O
responsible O
for O
controlling O
building O
standards O
would O
ever O
dream O
of O
turning O
a O
blind O
eye O
to O
a O
little O
corner O
cutting O
in O
return O
for O
the O
odd O
back O
hander O
. O

in O
answer O
to O
the O
basic O
question O
NO O
! O
! O

if O
you O
start O
taking O
personal O
responsibility O
for O
everything O
at O
all O
subcontractors O
, O
suppliers O
etc O
then O
you O
will O
drive O
yourself O
into O
an O
early O
grave O
. O

being O
a O
shareholder O
in O
the O
company O
you O
buy O
from O
may O
give O
you O
some O
different O
" O
responsibilities O
" O
but O
until O
then O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O

keep O
buying O
, O
there O
are O
others O
who O
will O
be O
looking O
over O
the O
shoulders O
of O
those O
who O
are O
cutting O
corners O
. O

Sorry O
Dom B-PER
the O
answer O
is O
YES O

We O
should O
be O
buying O
British B-GPE
made O
goods O
and O
keeping O
down O
our O
benefits O
bill O
. O

Or O
Spanish B-GPE
made O

must O
disagree O
Fred B-PER
, O
you O
are O
behind O
the O
times O
, O
the O
UK B-GPE
has O
little O
or O
no O
manufacturing O
facilities O
for O
these O
goods O
, O
the O
buyers O
from O
the O
retail O
shops O
would O
never O
think O
to O
" O
buy O
local O
" O
, O
the O
price O
would O
be O
too O
high O

just O
watch O
Coronation O
Street O
. O

Perhaps O
is O
it O
is O
these O
buyers O
who O
should O
take O
the O
blame O
, O
they O
should O
be O
ensuring O
the O
correct O
standards O
are O
maintained O

but O
we O
know O
the O
couldn O
' O
g O
give O
a O
shit O
so O
long O
as O
the O
price O
is O
LOW O

just O
remember O
that O
every O
item O
sold O
in O
the O
uk B-GPE
high O
street O
for O
£ O
5 O
is O
costing O
less O
than O
£ O
1 O
. O
00 O
. O

It O
is O
called O
profit O
. O

And O
when O
they O
have O
a O
50 O
% O
of O
sale O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
season O
they O
are O
still O
making O
at O
least O
100 O
% O
profit O
. O

so O
, O
you O
want O
the O
little O
girly O
shopping O
at O
Zavvi B-ORG
or O
similar O
to O
become O
worried O
about O
the O
conditions O
the O
workers O
have O
to O
work O
, O
live O
, O
even O
die O
in O
. O

No O
Chance O
. O

they O
are O
not O
interested O
, O
if O
it O
is O
50p O
dearer O
than O
New B-ORG
Look I-ORG
they O
will O
show O
no O
loyalty O
whatsoever O
, O
just O
go O
their O
. O

and O
as O
to O
Fashion O
, O
that O
is O
lead O
by O
similarly O
empty O
headed O
buyers O
who O
decide O
the O
market O
, O
show O
no O
loyalty O
to O
a O
given O
factory O
, O
to O
a O
group O
of O
workers O
. O

the O
profit O
is O
the O
name O
of O
the O
game O

sorry O
, O
I O
can O
have O
no O
responsibility O
for O
the O
actions O
of O
others O
in O
such O
a O
dog O
eat O
dog O
world O
. O

It O
isn O
' O
t O
just O
the O
cheap O
high O
street O
brands O
who O
have O
their O
products O
manufactured O
in O
countries O
where O
working O
conditions O
are O
appalling O
, O
though O
: O
- O

It O
' O

all O
about O
maximising O

at O
whatever O

point O
in O
the O

they O
are O

The O
unacceptable O
face O
of O

I O
remember O
seeing O
a O
brass O

. O

Absolutely O
correct O
Dom B-PER
, O
but O
that O
does O
not O
alter O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
should O
be O
buying O

I O
agree O
but O
it O
' O

not O

possible O

there O
is O
a O

off O

I O
can O
see O
inviting O
the O

, O
but O
the O
president O
himself O
almost O
makes O
this O
a O
political O
endorsement O
. O

Also O
if O
the O

as O
it O

from O

have O
already O
been O
made O
with O
NYC B-GPE

a O
certain O

revered O

If O
they O
see O
that O

used O

bastion O
of O

they O
will O
either O
be O

that O

as O

anything O

I O

really O
, O
if O

were O
sent O
to O
a O

to O
get O
your O

and O
the O
repair O

handed O
it O
off O

an O
" O
expert O

" O
because O
he O
was O
actually O
an O

then O
billed O

both O

' O

you O
' O
d O
say O
that O

was O
incompetent O

should O
never O
have O
been O
given O
the O
work O
in O

How O
is O
this O
any O
different O
? O

Because O
lawyers O
are O
special O
flowers O
who O
get O
to O
take O
work O
they O
don O
' O
t O
know O
how O
to O

bill O
fabulous O
amounts O
of O
money O
for O

Lets O
see O
what O
she O

And O
then O
lets O
see O
how O
long O
it O
takes O
for O
Apple B-ORG
to O
file O
for O
an O
emergency O
stay O
. O

My O
guess O
is O
that O
it O
is O
all O
ready O
to O
go O
and O
just O
waiting O
for O
her O
to O
file O
her O
explanation O
. O

Apple B-ORG
will O
fight O
hard O
to O
keep O
anyone O
who O
doesn O
' O
t O
belong O
out O
of O
their O
secrets O
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
even O
begin O
to O
understand O
why O
the O
court O
would O
be O
unwilling O
to O
assign O
a O
new O
monitor O
. O

Why O
does O
it O
matter O
who O
the O
monitor O
is O
, O
if O
there O
isn O
' O
t O
something O
shady O
going O
on O
. O

It O
is O
very O
apparent O
that O
there O
most O
likely O
is O
a O
conflict O
of O
personality O
between O
the O
current O
monitor O
and O
Apple B-ORG
and O
that O
both O
parties O
feel O
like O
it O
is O
impeding O
their O
ability O
to O
get O
work O
accomplished O
. O

Seems O
simple O
, O
change O
out O
the O
monitor O
. O

If O
the O
monitor O
is O
doing O
what O
they O
are O
assigned O
to O
do O
why O
does O
it O
matter O
who O
the O
monitor O
is O
. O

This O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
very O
odd O
response O
especially O
in O
light O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
monitor O
( O
Bromwich B-PER

is O
an O

why O
did O

attack O
the O

regime O
? O

I O
sort O
of O
follow O
the O
syrian B-GPE
war O
and O
know O
about O
the O
US B-GPE
wanting O
to O
arm O
the O

and O
now O

that O

are O

but O
how O
did O
it O
all O
start O
? O

why O
did O
the O
rebels O
first O
attack O
? O

It O
started O
because O
terrorist O
wanting O
to O
fight O
our O
forces O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
came O
through O
Syria B-GPE
. O

We O
let O
this O
border O
be O
the O
weak O
crossing O
because O
the O
terrain O
best O
suited O
our O
ability O
to O
fight O
. O

We O
formed O
a O
" O
V O
" O
like O
funnel O
starting O
at O
each O
end O
if O
the O
Syrian B-GPE
Iraq B-GPE
border O
. O

This O
was O
only O
one O
of O
the O
ingenious O
strategies O
used O
by O
the O
Bush B-PER
administration O
' O
s O
War O
Against O
Terrorist O
. O
" O

We O
picked O
the O
battlefield O
. O

We O
used O
heavy O
bombardment O
in O
the O
areas O
of O
fortifications O
. O

This O
forced O
them O
out O
of O
their O
plan O
. O

Which O
was O
to O
take O
us O
on O
like O
they O
did O
the O
Russians O
. O

Additionally O
this O
cut O
off O
their O
command O
and O
control O
therefore O
the O
leadership O
could O
not O
effectively O
formulate O
a O
new O
strategy O
. O

Intelligence O
told O
us O
there O
were O
terrorist O
sells O
had O
been O
deployed O
all O
over O
the O
world O
. O

We O
fed O
them O
misinformation O
getting O
them O
to O
join O
the O
fight O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

Where O
be O
killed O
countless O
terrorist O
. O

The O
strategy O
worked O
until O
we O
expanded O
our O
efforts O
in O
Afghanistan B-GPE
. O

Now O
we O
are O
bogged O
down O
. O

We O
should O
have O
stayed O
with O
the O
pre O
- O
Obama B-PER
strategy O
of O
keeping O
boots O
on O
the O
ground O
in O
Afghanistan B-GPE
to O
a O
minimum O
and O
using O
small O
rapid O
deployment O
forces O
to O
move O
in O
attack O
and O
move O
out O
. O

The O
answer O
to O
your O
question O
is O
this O
strategy O
caused O
many O
non O
- O
Syrians O
to O
relocate O
in O
Syria B-GPE
. O

The O
Syrian B-GPE
government O
came O
under O
attack O
because O
they O
were O
not O
aggressive O
enough O
against O
the O
west B-LOC
. O

Plus O
they O
were O
seen O
as O
not O
joining O
the O
fight O
against O
us O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

Finely O
that O
is O
what O
Muslims O
do O
fight O
for O
Salvation O
. O

That O
is O
the O
only O
way O
Allah O
looks O
favorably O
on O
Muslims O
. O

Fight O
is O
what O
Muslims O
do O
. O

thanks O
for O
the O
quick O
reply O

So O
it O
seems O
like O
the O
USA B-GPE
wanted O
the O
rebel O
forces O
to O
go O
against O
syria B-GPE
by O
putting O
them O
in O
syria B-GPE
and O
having O
syria B-GPE
not O
help O
them O
? O

and O
now O
that O
the O
US B-GPE
and O
EU B-GPE
are O
wanting O
to O
and O
going O
to O
arm O
the O
rebels O
could O
it O
be O
that O
that O
was O
their O
plan O
in O
the O
first O
place O
to O
take O

We O
did O
not O
want O
( O
Bush B-PER

this O
consequence O
but O
selected O
the O
best O
war O
strategy O
. O

I O
believe O
Obama B-PER
withdrew O
security O
from O
Benghazi B-GPE

spread O
the O
rumor O
that O
Stevens B-PER
was O
gay O
because O
he O
was O
going O

with O
our O
arming O
of O

in O

Notice O
the O
focus O
is O
on O
bad O
public O
information O
and O
the O
real O
issue O
. O

Obama B-PER
had O
Stevens B-PER
and O
the O
few O
that O
attempted O
to O
save O
him O
murdered O
! O

OR O

Stevens B-PER

they O

The O

Pataki B-PER
did O
enough O

right O

Then O
it O
passed O
and O
most O
were O
in O
shock O

Then O
everyone O
ran O
to O
buy O
10 O

they O
did O
so O
quick O
enough O
to O

Why O
on O

we O
assume O
that O

would O
be O
anything O

the O
truth O
? O

I O
honestly O
feel O
that O
the O
NYS B-GPE

is O
going O
to O
do O
everything O
it O

that O
your O

simply O
cannot O

one O

Sorry O

heated O
so O
quickly O

I O
simply O
cannot O
stand O

I O
' O

there O

really O
only O

seems O
overkill O
for O

Maybe O
if O
I O
used O

with O
a O

even O
so O
, O
I O
think O
that O
for O

need O

would O
prefer O

that O
would O

from O
more O

. O

Someone O
other O
than O
a O
Steve O

Stephen O
maybe O
? O

I O
think O
these O
Computer O
Giants O
should O
stop O
making O

with O
Steve O
as O
their O
first O

Maybe O
someone O

even O
someone O
with O
an O
awesome O
Irish B-GPE

something O

Anything O
but O
Steve O

Because O
then O
it O
really O
is O
going O
to O
get O
to O
the O
point O
where O

this O

it O
should O
be O
one O

Let O
' O

hope O

follows O

There O
is O
going O

where O
we O
look O
at O

think O
' O
eek O

' O

have O
done O
that O
' O
or O
' O
he O
hasn O
' O

changed O

' O
but O
we O
need O
to O
put O
these O

happen O

With O
that O
said O

so O

I O

Brilliant O
news O
. O

This O
will O
do O
more O
to O
fight O
the O
" O
War O
on O
Terror O
" O
than O
anything O
Bush B-PER
/ O
Cheney B-PER
have O
done O
since O
this O
camp O
was O
set O
up O
. O

The O
US B-GPE
can O
start O
rebuilding O
the O
bridges O
that O
have O
been O
destroyed O
over O
the O
past O
eight O
years O
and O
genuinely O
win O
hearts O
and O
minds O
instead O
of O
chasing O
people O
into O
the O
arms O
of O
extremists O
. O

Starting O
to O
look O
like O
the O
history O
of O
the O
USA B-GPE
between O
2000 O
and O
2016 O
will O
be O
summed O
up O
by O
the O
phrase O
Shock O
and O
Awe O
. O

Quite O
ironic O
really O

I O
hope O
he O
' O
s O
got O
a O
plan O
for O
dealing O
with O
the O
detainees O
who O
aren O
' O
t O
going O
to O
be O
charged O
but O
can O
' O
t O
be O
sent O
home O
. O

I O
think O
that O
will O
be O
one O
of O
the O
biggest O
challenges O
. O

Do O
we O
let O
China B-GPE
have O
them O
cause O
it O
thinks O
they O
are O
guilty O
for O
example O
? O

If O
they O
are O
innocent O
and O
just O
got O
caught O
up O
because O
of O
$ O
$ O
bounties O
, O
do O
we O
allow O
them O
to O
stay O
in O
the O
US B-GPE
if O
communities O
offer O
to O
help O
them O
integrate O
? O

Why O
couldn O
' O
t O
they O
be O
sent O
home O
? O

Because O
some O
of O
their O
former O
home O
countries O
won O
' O
t O
allow O
them O
to O
return O
. O

There O
could O
be O
personal O
safety O
issues O
if O
some O
of O
them O
are O
sent O
home O
. O

There O
could O
be O
situations O
where O
their O
lives O
could O
be O
in O
jeopardy O
. O

The O
article O
says O
that O
their O
home O
country O
does O
not O
want O
them O
back O
. O

But O
this O
is O
what O
confuses O
me O
. O

If O
they O
are O
proven O
innocent O
, O
why O
doesnt O
the O
country O
have O
them O
back O
? O

EDIT O
: O
Nvm O
, O
the O
poster O
above O
me O
answered O
it O
I O
guess O
. O

Not O
" O
our O
" O
problem O
. O

Give O
them O
a O
chute O
, O
and O
bombs O
- O
away O
. O

There O
' O
s O
a O
difference O
between O
proven O
innocent O
and O
not O
charged O
with O
anything O
. O

If O
for O
example O
a O
prisoner O
is O
in O
Guantanamo B-FAC
because O
he O
fought O
with O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
in O
Afghanistan B-GPE
, O
the O
Afghan B-GPE
government O
is O
probably O
not O
going O
to O
permit O
their O
readmission O
to O
the O
country O
after O
their O
release O
. O

I O
expect O
the O
same O
would O
be O
true O
of O
Saudi B-GPE
nationals O
. O

This O
could O
be O
a O
sticky O
problem O

If O

it O
happened O

put O

would O
you O
put O
it O
? O

Is O

They O
could O
just O
a O
easily O
do O
it O

our O

They O
could O
just O
decide O
that O
20 O

of O
your O

now O
has O
to O
be O
in O

Russians O

There O
is O
no O
competition O
to O
drive O
that O
innovation O
any O
more O

Very O
true O
. O

But O
I O
wish O
we O
could O
say O
that O
our O
desire O
for O
knowledge O
would O
be O
enough O
for O
that O
level O
of O
exploration O
, O
rather O
than O
another O
cold O
war O
pushing O
us O
. O

Agreed O
. O

Especially O
as O
there O
is O
no O
need O
any O
longer O
for O
one O
nation O
to O
bear O
the O
cost O
alone O
. O

This O
is O
something O
that O
could O
drive O
technological O
innovation O
for O
the O
whole O
world O
, O
while O
still O
harking O
back O
to O
Armstrong B-PER
' O
s O
" O
One O
giant O
leap O
for O
mankind O
" O

You O
' O
re O
right O
, O
however O
, O
there O
is O
a O
part O
of O
me O
as O
an O
American O
that O
still O
wants O
to O
see O
the O
US B-GPE
lead O
the O
way O
on O
our O
own O
, O
and O
not O
do O
joint O
ventures O
. O

Right O
, O
wrong O
or O
indifferent O
, O
there O
' O
s O
no O
doubt O
my O
feeling O
is O
a O
pride O
thing O
. O

Then O
you O
have O
to O
argue O
with O
multiple O
nations O
over O
who O
pays O
for O
what O
, O
what O
the O
objectives O
will O
be O
, O
where O
to O
launch O
, O
which O
nation O
the O
astronauts O
come O
from O
, O
and O
so O
forth O
. O

It O
' O
d O
just O
make O
a O
difficult O
mission O
even O
more O
difficult O
. O

In O
the O
end O
the O
US B-GPE
would O
probably O
end O
up O
paying O
for O
most O
of O
it O
as O
usual O
. O

So O
why O
not O
do O
it O
all O
and O
not O
deal O
with O
all O
the O
international O
politicking O
? O

It O
would O
be O
of O
better O
benefit O
to O
the O
US B-GPE
as O
all O
the O
tech O
they O
came O
up O
with O
would O
be O
patented O
to O
US B-GPE
companies O
. O

Sure O
it O
' O
s O
expensive O
but O
not O
too O
expensive O
. O

The O
estimates O
I O
read O
indicate O
that O
five O
to O
eleven O
manned O
missions O
could O
be O
launched O
for O
the O
cost O
of O
the O
Iraq B-GPE
war O
. O

That O
cost O
could O
be O
recouped O
by O
the O
economy O
. O

If O
the O
companies O
paid O
to O
design O
new O
technologies O
were O
required O
to O
manufacture O
any O
patented O
device O
or O
material O
in O
the O
US B-GPE
for O
the O
duration O
of O
the O
patent O
, O
as O
a O
stipulation O
in O
the O
contract O
bidding O
process O
. O

The O
International B-FAC
Space I-FAC
Station I-FAC
is O
a O
good O
example O
of O
international O
cooperation O
. O

Astronauts O
from O
multiple O
countries O
, O
including O
Americans O
being O
lifted O
to O
the O
ISS B-FAC
on O
Russian B-GPE
rockets O
. O

The O
threats O
we O
face O
- O
as O
a O
planet O
- O
are O
now O
global O
in O
nature O
. O

The O
solutions O
we O
develop O
, O
including O
space O
exploration O
, O
should O
also O
be O
global O
. O

We O
should O
have O
been O
well O
past O
the O
point O
where O

pride O
takes O
precedence O
over O
what O
is O
good O
for O

Death O
of O
Mandela B-PER

The O
victors O
always O
get O
to O
write O
the O
history O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
' O
m O
concerned O
he O
was O
just O
another O
terrorist O
. O

Seeing O
so O
many O
' O
bleeding O
hearts O
' O
and O
outpouring O
of O
grief O
at O
the O
death O
of O
this O
self O
confessed O
terrorist O
, O
bomber O
and O
murderer O
of O
the O
innocents O
, O
makes O
me O
wonder O
what O
will O
happen O
when O
that O
other O
much O
admired O
' O
freedom O
fighter O
' O
Martin B-PER
Mcguiness I-PER
finally O
pops O
his O
clogs O
. O
. O
. O
a O
state O
funeral O
perhaps O
? O

I O
partly O
agree O
but O
sometimes O
, O
however O
difficult O
it O
can O
be O
, O
you O
have O
to O
deal O
with O
bad O
people O
to O
make O
things O
happen O
for O
the O
common O
good O

It O
can O
be O
a O
bitch O
but O
there O
it O
is O

That O
' O
s O
the O
way O
its O
always O
been O

a O
pretty O
selective O
article O
but O
then O
I O
guess O
it O
will O
please O
its O
target O
audience O
. O

On O
the O
subject O
of O
being O
friends O
with O
dictators O
, O
you O
do O
realise O
that O
in O
order O
to O
defeat O
one O
dictator O
, O
Hitler B-PER
, O
your O
nation O
allied O
itself O
with O
an O
even O
bigger O
dictator O
, O
Stalin B-PER
? O

Sometimes O
you O
gotta O
deal O
with O
the O
devil O

Personally O
I O
' O
d O
rather O
" O
deal O
with O
them O
" O
then O
have O
dealings O
with O
them O
. O

Political O
leaders O
are O
all O
murdering O
bastards O
. O

It O
' O
s O
what O
they O
do O
. O

All O
the O
little O
Thatcherites O
that O
wanted O
to O
hang O
Mandela B-PER
were O
quick O
enough O
at O
voting O
her O
in O
. O

She O
was O
no O
pacifist O
. O

Sometimes O
you O
have O
no O
choice O

The O
dumb O
f O
* O
* O
k O
Dutchies O
had O
painted O
themselves O
into O
a O
corner O

What O
absolute O
garbage O
and O
please O
don O
' O
t O
mention O
Mcguiness B-PER
in O
the O
same O
breath O
as O
Mandela B-PER
. O

Whatever O
the O
ANC B-ORG
did O
was O
justified O
by O
the O
introduction O
of O
apartheid O
. O

Whatever O
happens O
in O
SA B-GPE
at O
least O
it O
will O
be O
decided O
by O
the O
vast O
majority O
that O
are O
indigenous O
to O
that O
region O
. O

A O
lot O
of O
Yarpies O
didn O
' O
t O
get O
the O
kicking O
they O
probably O
deserved O
. O

Microsoft B-ORG
should O
' O
ve O
let O
Stephen B-PER
Elop I-PER
go O

First O
he O
starts O
his O
layoff O
memo O
with O
the O
phrase O
" O
Hello O
There O
" O
. O

Then O
it O
takes O
until O
the O
11th O
paragraph O
to O
actually O
mention O
12 O
, O
500 O
people O
would O
be O
losing O
their O
jobs O
. O

And O
this O
is O
the O
way O
he O
announced O
it O
: O

" O
we O
plan O
to O
support O
departing O
team O
members O
with O
severance O
benefits O
" O
is O
all O
the O
sympathy O
or O
feeling O
he O
can O
muster O
? O

And O
when O
he O
says O
" O
these O
decisions O
are O
difficult O
for O
the O
team O
" O
it O
sounds O
so O
impersonal O
and O
uncaring O
, O
as O
if O
he O
feels O
bad O
for O
himself O
and O
his O
managers O
, O
not O
the O
people O
losing O
their O
jobs O
. O

Also O
, O
why O
spread O
this O
out O
over O
a O
year O
? O

The O
most O
painless O
way O
to O
implement O
job O
cuts O
is O
do O
them O
quickly O
. O

Why O
not O
tell O
people O
now O
but O
give O
them O
time O
to O
either O
find O
another O
job O
within O
the O
company O
or O
externally O
? O

I O
can O
' O
t O
see O
how O
this O
is O
good O
for O
morale O
. O

Who O
would O
give O
100 O
% O
not O
knowing O
if O
they O
' O
re O
one O
of O
the O
18 O
, O
000 O
or O
not O
? O

Elop B-PER
is O
the O
one O
that O
needs O
to O
go O
. O

Could O
it O
be O
the O
memo O
was O
written O
in O
another O
language O
and O
something O
was O
lost O
in O
translation O
. O

Or O
at O
the O
very O
least O
, O
taking O
the O
conventions O
of O
another O
language O
and O
culture O
. O

We O
Americans O
want O
to O
get O
to O
the O
point O
. O

Give O
me O
bullet O
items O
, O
where O
as O
other O
cultures O
tend O
to O
be O
more O
expansive O
. O

I O
won O
' O
t O
criticize O
for O
over O
communicating O
, O
though O
he O
does O
seem O
to O
be O
beating O
around O
the O
bush O
. O

Elop B-PER
was O
placed O
at O
Nokia B-ORG
by O
Microsoft B-ORG
with O
what O
was O
likely O
a O
known O
safety O
clause O
to O
return O
to O
Microsoft B-ORG
, O
once O
Nokia B-ORG
was O
absorbed O
. O

I O
doubt O
he O
gives O
two O
craps O
about O
the O
Nokia B-ORG
employees O
. O

I O
think O
they O
knew O
they O
were O
cannon O
fodder O
the O
second O
rumors O
came O
out O
that O
Microsoft B-ORG
would O
be O
buying O
Nokia B-ORG
. O

And O
I O
have O
no O
love O
for O
Elop B-PER
. O

This O
is O
one O
of O
those O
monkey O
' O
s O
that O
Microsoft B-ORG
still O
has O
in O
their O
ranks O
from O
the O
Ballmer B-PER
days O
and O
should O
be O
axed O
by O
Nadella B-PER
. O

But O
the O
guy O
probably O
has O
a O
clause O
or O
contract O
preventing O
such O
action O
at O
this O
time O
. O

When O
that O

I O

' O

, O
but O
I O
' O

try O

it O

Thanks O
for O
the O

No O

You O
' O

love O
it O

Just O
did O
the O

they O
even O

it O

I O
' O

even O
though O
I O

I O
love O
that O
stuff O
. O

I O
could O
never O
even O
begin O
to O
fathom O
how O
it O
' O
s O
done O
, O
but O
I O
find O
space O
exploration O
and O
physics O
insanely O
interesting O
. O

I O
' O
m O
the O
same O
way O
. O

My O
dad O

the O
masters O

any O

I O
love O
seeing O

shot O
from O

, O

. O

Have O
you O
seen O
a O
shuttle O
launch O
? O

I O
got O
lucky O
enough O
to O
go O
see O
one O
like O
6 O
years O
ago O
or O
so O
. O

It O
was O
the O
same O
week O
as O
they O
flew O
two O
shuttles O
back O
to O
Florida B-GPE
piggybacked O
in O
the O
same O
day O
. O

I O
have O
not O
. O

I O
bet O
that O
was O
awesome O
! O

I O
' O
m O
jealous O
. O

I O
lived O
in O
the O
Orlando B-GPE
area O
and O
went O
and O
saw O
STS O
- O
67 O
launch O
at O
1 O
: O
38 O
am O
EST O
. O

It O
was O
one O
of O
the O
most O
amazing O
things O
I O
have O
ever O
seen O
. O

I O
was O
able O
to O
see O
the O
smoke O
trails O
from O
most O
launches O
from O
my O
home O
providing O
that O
there O
wasn O
' O
t O
too O
much O
cloud O
cover O
. O

I O
also O
heard O
the O
twin O
sonic O
booms O
as O
the O
shuttles O
were O
returning O
to O
the O
Kennedy B-FAC

strategy O
( O

along O
with O
it O
a O
2700 O

worded O
memo O

One O
year O

we O
get O
another O
extremely O
long O
memo O
from O
Nadella B-PER

and O

renamed O
mobile O
and O

. O

If O
I O
worked O
for O
Microsoft B-ORG
I O
' O
d O
be O
a O
little O
worried O
about O
needing O
these O
long O
memos O
to O
communicate O
what O
Microsoft B-ORG
is O
all O
about O
. O

And O
then O
getting O
two O
of O
them O
within O
a O
year O
of O
each O
other O
. O

Seems O
to O
me O
things O
would O
be O
a O
lot O
clearer O
if O
Microsoft B-ORG
spun O
off O
its O
hardware O
business O
. O

Getting O
into O
the O
devices O
business O
is O
a O
distraction O
IMO O
. O

It O
' O
s O
difficult O
to O
be O
both O
horizontal O
and O
vertical O
. O

I O
still O
think O
their O
Nokia B-ORG
purchase O
was O
more O
about O
saving O
Windows O
Phone O
platform O
than O
wanting O
to O
get O
in O
the O
phone O
hardware O
business O
. O

Spin O
off O
XBox O
, O
Surface O
and O
Windows O
Phone O
devices O
into O
a O
separate O
company O
and O
let O
Microsoft B-ORG
focus O
on O
what O
it O
does O
best O
- O
software O
and O
services O
. O

Microsoft B-ORG
just O
can O
' O
t O
stop O
" O
rebooting O
" O
. O

Partly O
to O
save O
the O
platform O
and O
partly O
to O
mimic O
apple B-ORG
. O

They O
see O
the O
wisdom O
of O
a O
tightly O
integrated O
OS O
and O
hardware O
. O

That O
' O
s O
the O
problem O
. O

Ballmer B-PER
felt O
Microsoft B-ORG
needed O
to O
mimick O
Apple B-ORG
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
think O
Nadella B-PER
does O
. O

Making O
a O
touch O
version O
of O

first O
proves O
it O
. O

It O
' O
s O
interesting O
that O
this O
quarter O
Apple B-ORG
and O
Microsoft B-ORG
report O
earnings O
on O
the O
same O
day O
( O
July O
22 O
) O
. O

I O
' O
m O
seeing O
some O
predictions O
of O
layoffs O
at O
Microsoft B-ORG
. O

I O
would O
not O
be O
surprised O
if O
they O
announce O
org O
changes O
and O
layoffs O
with O
their O
earnings O
release O
. O

I O
' O
m O
sure O
the O
stock O
will O
jump O
on O
that O
news O
as O
Microsoft B-ORG
is O
kind O
of O
bloated O
, O
but O
I O
' O
ll O
bet O
if O
they O
announced O
a O
spinoff O
of O
their O
hardware O
business O
the O
stock O
would O
jump O
even O
more O
. O

I O
would O
not O
be O
surprise O
if O
within O
the O
next O
5 O
years O
Microsoft B-ORG
sheds O
it O
' O
s O
hardware O
business O
. O

Microsoft B-ORG
' O

Entertainment B-ORG
Division I-ORG
( O
the O
people O
that O

X O
- O

and O
the O

) O
are O
their O
most O
profitable O
in O
terms O
of O
hardware O
. O

That O
alone O
should O
be O
a O
company O
. O

I O
think O
Microsoft B-ORG
as O
a O
company O
has O
so O
much O
to O
offer O
if O
they O
focus O
on O
what O
brought O
them O
to O
their O
heights O
. O

That O
focus O
should O
be O
on O
software O
on O
many O
devices O
. O

Although O
, O
it O
would O
be O
pretty O
much O
interesting O
to O
see O
a O
Windows O
line O
of O

( O
branded O
by O
Microsoft B-ORG
' O
s O
a O
la O
Apple B-ORG
style O
with O

) O
. O

You O
never O
truly O
know O
your O
software O
' O
s O
potential O
until O
you O
mate O
it O
with O
extremely O
integrated O
hardware O
. O

This O
is O
what O
Apple B-ORG
has O
so O
far O
been O
doing O
; O
very O
well O
mind O
you O
. O

Bringing O
Office O
to O
iPad O
and O
Android O
is O
great O
decision O
. O

Microsoft B-ORG
would O
have O
lost O
marketshare O
to O
other O
productivity O
apps O
out O
there O
seeing O
as O
they O
would O
have O
been O
alienating O

' O
Dat O
Memo O

I O
saw O
that O
and O
was O
surprised O
to O
a O
degree O
. O

I O
guess O
Nadella B-PER
is O
looking O
to O
sharpen O
its O
focus O
and O
cut O
out O
some O
of O
the O
bloat O
that O
creeps O
into O
an O

. O

Nadella B-PER

The O
fact O
that O

has O
changes O
to O
make O

how O

hardly O

set O
, O
Putin B-PER
evidently O
refuses O
to O
acknowledge O
that O
the O

are O
motivated O
by O
the O
intense O
frustration O
with O
post O

What O
infuriated O
Ukrainians O
when O
Yanukovych B-PER
balked O
at O
closer O
ties O
with O
the O
European B-GPE
Union I-GPE
was O
the O
sense O
that O
their O
ambitions O
and O
hopes O
were O
utterly O
disregarded O
. O

It O
was O
the O
same O
keen O
sense O
of O
humiliation O
that O
drove O
tens O
of O
thousands O
of O
Russians O
into O
the O
streets O
after O
Putin B-PER
almost O
casually O
declared O
that O
he O
would O
seek O
the O
presidency O
again O
in O
2012 O
. O

“ O
Many O
polls O
found O
that O
the O
main O
driver O
of O
protests O
in O
Russia B-GPE
was O
the O
sense O
of O

which O
they O
appeared O
after O
Yanukovych B-PER
decided O
against O
signing O
an O
association O

with O
Europe B-GPE
, O
cannot O
be O
dismissed O
as O
a O
Western B-LOC

By O
all O

the O

understood O
that O

was O
not O
offering O
a O
panacea O
for O
their O
economic O
and O

they O
expected O
little O
from O
the O

of O
Yanukovych B-PER

it O

Quite O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
he O
was O
also O
a O
terrorist O
seems O
to O
have O
been O
forgotten O
. O

I O
felt O
the O
same O
. O

not O
really O
knowing O
much O
about O
his O
early O
life O
, O
really O
should O
go O
download O
a O
book O
, O
but O
thought O
he O
was O
cited O
for O
organising O
armed O
action O
and O
more O
. O

But O
then O
I O
read O
a O
book O
that O
called O
Jesus B-PER
a O
terrorist O
so O
looks O
like O
both O
made O
good O
in O
the O
end O

Just O
watched O
a O
programme O
on O
the O
BBC O
about O
his O
like O
, O
and O
yes O
he O
organised O
' O
terrorist O
' O
attacks O
, O
but O
they O
were O
confined O
to O
blowing O
up O
power O
pylons O
and O
attacking O
government O
and O
police O
buildings O
but O
attacking O
people O
wasn O
' O
t O
part O
of O
the O
plan O
, O
however O
while O
he O
was O
in O
prison O
, O
young O
members O
of O
the O
ANC B-ORG
did O
escalate O
the O
action O
. O

This O
was O
mainly O
in O
response O
to O
the O
Soweto B-LOC
massacre O
, O
but O
there O
was O
tribal O
rivalry O
between O
the O
ANC B-ORG
and O
Incarta B-ORG
, O
however O
Mandela B-PER
was O
on O
Robben B-LOC
Island I-LOC
at O
that O
time O
. O

ahh O
the O
little O
that O
I O
read O
said O
he O
was O
involved O
in O
planning O
armed O
action O
and O
a O
conspiracy O
to O
help O
other O
countries O
invade O
South B-GPE

An O
interesting O
interpretation O
by O
Mishal B-PER
Husain I-PER
: O

Having O
studied O
the O
history O
of O
apartheid O
in O
South B-GPE
Africa I-GPE
in O
school O
it O
seemed O
to O
me O
a O
long O
list O
of O
massacres O
: O

I O
dug O
out O
some O
other O
quotes O
: O

And O
relevant O
today O
. O
. O
. O
. O

For O
me O
, O
his O
greatest O
achievements O
happened O
after O
he O
left O
prison O
. O

Along O
with O
De B-PER
Klerk I-PER
, O
he O
deserved O
his O
Nobel B-PER
Peace O
Prize O
. O

For O
me O
two O
wrongs O
don O
' O
t O
make O
a O
right O
. O

But O
that O
is O
just O
my O
opinion O
. O

I O
can O
well O
understand O
the O
anger O
that O
black O
people O
must O
' O
ve O
felt O
under O
the O
abhorrent O
regime O
of O
apartheid O
. O

I O
' O
m O
so O
pleased O
that O
Nelson B-PER
Mandela I-PER
, O
went O
on O
to O
live O
the O
life O
he O
did O
after O
his O
release O
from O
prison O
. O

Jesus O
is O
a O
moot O
point O
as O
there O
is O
no O
proof O
that O
he O
ever O
existed O
. O

The O
world O
has O
lost O
a O
great O
man O
but O
on O
the O
plus O
side O
his O
family O
have O
kept O
him O
alive O
long O
enough O

to O
put O

way O

will O
be O
leaving O

the O

Avie B-PER
Tevanian I-PER
currently O
holds O
the O
position O
of O

and O
was O
previously O
the O
vice O
president O
of O
Engineering B-ORG
at O
NeXT B-ORG
. O

Tevanian B-PER
was O
one O
of O
the O
principal O
designers O
and O
engineers O
of O
the O
Mach O
operating O

on O
which O
NEXTSTEP O

subsequently O

Tevanian B-PER
had O
previously O
been O
rumored O
to O
have O
been O
leaving O

So O
what O
, O
now O
that O
the O
OS O

transition O
is O
complete O
, O
there O
' O
s O
no O
need O
for O
Avie B-PER
? O

I O
wonder O
if O
this O
is O
a O
good O
move O
, O
or O
a O
bad O
move O
. O

Fishes O
, O

narco O
. O

Saw O
this O
a O
bit O
earlier O

. O
. O
a O
brilliant O

Apple B-ORG
will O
be O
hard O
- O
pressed O
to O
find O
another O
visionary O
like O
Avie B-PER
to O
lead O
OS O
development O
going O
forward O
. O

Obviously O
a O
lot O
of O
balls O
are O
already O
rolling O
and O
will O
keep O
users O
happy O
for O
a O
while O
, O
but O
they O
need O
someone O
to O
develop O
a O
cohesive O
plan O
for O
the O
future O
of O
the O
Mac O
OS O
. O

But O
then O
again O
, O
maybe O
some O
new O
blood O
will O
lead O
to O
radical O
new O
ideas O
that O
could O
turn O
out O
great O
for O
users O
. O

Not O
Avie B-PER

a O

With O

could O
we O
see O
the O

? O

Could O
get O
interesting O

Not O

I O
wonder O
if O
this O

the O
wrong O

We O
already O
know O

on O
March O

I O

went O
up O

Must O
feel O
good O
when O

causes O
the O

to O
increase O

10 O

. O

About O
time O
. O

. O

Maybe O
now O
they O
' O
ll O
finally O
be O
able O
to O
ditch O
the O
frickin O

piece O
of O

that O

Many O

use O

rather O
than O

so O

I O
' O
ve O
heard O

started O
to O
take O
over O

secure O
some O
cities O

the O

happening O
on O
30th O

Just O
left O
there O
yesterday O
, O
petrol O

diesel O
are O
in O
very O
short O

There O
were O

some O
of O

Cairo B-GPE

There O
is O

anyhow O
compared O

the O

Anyhow O
will O
be O
interesting O
to O
see O
if O
anything O
actually O
happens O
on O
the O
30th O

could O
be O
the O
usual O
amount O

not O
much O

I O
think O
it O
will O

tomorrow O

maybe O
even O
tonight O

something O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
asking O
the O

to O
do O
but O
it O
happens O
naturally O
now O

Well O
personally O
( O
not O
that O
I O
want O
a O
bloodbath O
) O
but O
I O
hope O
it O
does O
kick O
off O
, O
its O
about O
time O
the O
population O
woke O
up O
. O

I O
know O
many O
Egyptians O
who O
want O
the O
same O
. O

A O
good O
friend O
of O
mine O
wants O
a O
famine O
to O
hit O
the O
country O
* O
- O
their O
view O
is O
that O
without O
hitting O
rock O
bottom O
they O
cannot O
get O
up O
. O

* O
which O
isn O
' O
t O
that O
unlikely O
- O
given O
that O
they O
import O
40 O
% O
of O
their O
food O
and O
have O
no O
money O
. O

If O
the O
Nile B-LOC
is O
damned O
then O
they O
' O
ll O
have O
to O
import O
more O
too O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
Brotherhood B-ORG
gov O
. O

members O
wanted O
to O
bomb O
the O
dam O
Ethiopia B-GPE

building O
and O
or O
support O
rebels O
fighting O
the O
Ethiopian B-GPE
gov O
. O

If O
I O
was O
an O
Egyptian O
, O
I O
would O
agree O
with O
this O
. O

Egypt B-GPE
is O
a O
desert O
supported O
by O
water O
from O
the O
Nile B-LOC
. O

They O
are O
the O
largest O
population O
and O
have O
built O
their O
way O
of O
life O
( O
rightly O
or O
wrongly O
) O
based O
on O
water O
from O
it O
. O

Damning O
it O
up O
stream O
would O
be O
like O
taking O
away O
the O
UK B-GPE
' O
s O
ability O
to O
import O
oil O
. O

Going O
to O
war O
would O
make O
sense O
. O

Problem O
is O
that O
damn O
is O
partially O
financed O
and O
constructed O
by O
the O
Chinese O
. O

I O
can O
' O
t O
see O
the O
Egyptians O
really O
coming O
out O
of O
that O
fight O
. O

Freudian O
slip O
? O

From O
what O
I O
can O
gather O
most O
Egyptians O
are O
pissed O
of O
with O
morsi B-PER
. O

Even O
pro O
Muslim B-ORG

taxi O

were O
looking O
forward O
to O
the O

they O
want O

Egypt B-GPE
is O
deeply O

to O
the O
point O

are O
making O
grand O
communist O

about O
a O

magically O
up O
30 O

in O
a O

when O

are O
complaining O
that O

Always O
a O
good O
indicator O
that O
things O
are O
* O

ed O
when O
Stalinist O
or O
tactics O
are O
being O

I O
guess O
they O
would O
be O

The O
old O

completely O
screwed O
every O

I O
can O
' O

, O
let O
alone O
a O

You O
know O
what O
really O
grinds O
my O
gears O
. O

The B-ORG
Beatles I-ORG
weren O
' O
t O
even O
good O
. O

There O
, O
I O
said O
it O
, O
and O
I O
feel O
much O
better O
now O
. O

I O
feel O
like O
I O
' O
m O
taking O
crazy O
pills O
since O
everyone O
seems O
to O
disagree O
, O
but O
I O
can O
safely O
say O
I O
don O
' O
t O
like O
any O
of O
their O
tunes O
. O

In O
case O
you O
didn O
' O
t O
pick O
up O
on O
it O
, O
I O
think O
this O
case O
is O
completely O
unjustified O
. O

Okay O
, O
I O
' O
m O
gonna O
get O
outta O
this O
thread O
before O
y O
' O
all O
bite O
my O
head O
off O
and O
spit O
it O
back O
out O
onto O
the O
keyboard O
. O

I O
' O
m O
not O
even O
talking O
about O
the O
thing O
on O
my O
shoulders O
. O

I O
wouldn O
' O
t O
know O
about O
" O
Apple B-ORG
Music I-ORG
" O
if O
not O
for O
this O
lawsuit O
. O

What O
a O
frackin O
' O
waste O
of O
time O
. O

How O
can O
someone O
sue O
twice O
? O

I O
thought O
they O
already O
sued O
last O
year O
. O

Does O
Apple B-ORG
Legal I-ORG
just O
ignore O
them O
? O

I O
wish O
the O
Apple B-ORG
Music I-ORG
company O
would O
get O
caught O
with O
distributing O
Keynotes O
, O
installing O
Tiger O
on O
a O
Dell O
, O
or O
discuss O
detailed O
information O
on O
future O
products O
aftering O
signing O
a O
waiver O
not O
to O
discuss O
it O
. O

Then O
Apple B-ORG
could O
sue O
them O
. O

No O
new O
case O
here O
. O

This O
is O
simply O
last O
years O
case O
that O
has O
finally O
come O
round O
to O
a O
hearing O
in O
court O
. O

Unless O
of O
course O
someone O
finally O
decides O
to O
back O
down O
at O
the O
last O
minute O
. O

The O
English B-GPE
legal O
system O
can O
take O
a O
long O
time O
to O
work O
. O

Whatever O
the O
outcome O
, O
I O
' O
m O
sure O
there O
will O
be O
a O
lot O
of O
press O
. O

From O
my O
understanding O
Apple B-ORG
actually O
signed O
an O
agreement O
with O
" O
Apple B-ORG
" O
( O
the O
music O
company O
) O
explicitly O
stating O
that O
they O
would O
not O
use O
the O

related O
business O
. O

Apple B-ORG
( O
the O
computer O
company O
) O
subsequently O
infringed O
on O
the O
agreement O
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
see O
how O
Apple B-ORG
( O
the O
computer O
company O
) O
is O
not O
at O
fault O
here O
since O
they O
signed O
the O
agreement O
in O
the O
first O
place O
. O

Having O
said O
that O
this O
case O
will O
be O
settled O
with O
some O
" O
mula O
" O
. O

Move O
along O
folks O
. O
. O
. O
nothing O
to O
see O
here O
. O

That O
' O
s O
exactly O
what O
it O
is O
. O

thank O
you O
! O
! O
! O

finally O
, O
someone O
who O
agrees O
with O
me O
! O

They O
weren O
' O
t O
good O
in O
the O
60 O

, O
and O
they O
sure O
as O

this O

out O

it O
was O
a O

they O
clearly O
did O
conspire O

the O
evidence O
is O
clear O
for O
everyone O
to O

those O
who O

Amazon B-ORG
kept O
( O
and O
keeps O
) O
book O
prices O
low O
, O
people O
talk O
about O
a O
" O
monopoly O
" O
but O
it O
patently O
isn O
' O
t O
, O
there O
are O
numerous O
places O
to O
buy O
books O
from O

online O
or O
in O
print O
. O

The O
only O
monopoly O
( O
or O
to O
be O
accurate O
oligopoly O
) O
was O
the O
conspiracies O
of O
a O
handful O
of O
major O
publishers O
and O
Apple B-ORG
to O
keep O
prices O
high O
. O

Indeed O
. O

Customers O

authors O
are O
better O
served O
by O
Amazon B-ORG
' O

than O
Apple B-ORG
' O

. O

Hopefully O
this O
has O
put O
Apple B-ORG
in O
their O
place O
. O

But O
book O
prices O
have O
not O
changed O

Amazon B-ORG
still O
sells O
books O
as O
a O
loss O
lead O
at O
the O
author O

' O

expense O
, O
and O
iBooks O
are O
still O
MSRP O

. O

This O
whole O
thing O
accomplished O
nothing O
but O
putting O
money O
in O
lawyer O
' O
s O
pockets O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
the O
" O
conspirators O
" O
did O
was O
enact O
an O
agency O
model O
which O
keeps O
vendors O
like O
Amazon B-ORG
from O
instituting O
aggressive O
" O
loss O
leaders O
" O
. O

These O
below O
- O
cost O
prices O
which O
would O
eventually O
turn O
into O
predatory O
contract O
negotiations O
like O
we O
have O
now O
with O
Hatchette B-ORG

Warner I-ORG

And O
it O
' O
s O
not O
over O
for O
either O
Apple B-ORG
or O
Amazon B-ORG
. O

Of O
course O
book O
prices O
have O
changed O
! O
! O
! O

Previously O
Amazon B-ORG
was O
not O
allowed O
to O
sell O
books O
below O
a O
certain O
price O
, O
or O
loss O
lead O
. O

Now O
they O
are O
. O

They O
even O
had O
a O
sign O
on O
those O
books O
to O
the O
effect O
of O
" O
we O
arent O
allowed O
to O
sell O
these O
books O
below O
this O
price O
by O
the O
publisher O
" O
. O

Thats O
gone O
now O
and O
prices O
have O
dropped O

Whether O

not O

a O

that O
the O

In O
a O

sadly O

he O
embodied O
in O
his O
very O
person O
and O
in O
the O
way O
he O
lived O
his O
life O
the O
notion O
of O
the O
' O
philosopher O
king O
' O
, O
being O
ruler O
, O
mentor O
, O
leader O
and O
guide O
to O
his O

A O
truly O
impressive O
human O
being O
and O
inspirational O
leader O
, O
he O
played O
a O
transformational O
role O
which O
required O
physical O
and O
moral O
courage O
and O
political O
insight O
and O
wisdom O
. O

To O
find O
any O
of O
these O
in O

them O
all O

you O

up O
an O

terrified O
country O

then O
make O
a O
peaceful O

seem O
inevitable O
in O

was O
a O

I O
was O
lucky O
to O
have O
met O
him O
in O

working O

He O
impressed O
me O
with O
how O
nice O
he O
was O

That O
is O
a O
memory O
well O
worth O
cherishing O

I O
respect O
the O
many O
things O
he O
stood O
for O
. O

I O
was O
not O
a O
fan O
of O
the O
man O
himself O

I O
can O
say O
similar O
about O
other O
great O

again O
- O
it O
is O
not O
always O
about O
the O
person O

what O
they O
stood O
for O
and O
accomplished O
so O
I O
consider O
his O
deeds O
to O
be O
remarkable O
in O
our O

a O
golden O

Can O
' O
t O
but O
thinking O
that O
all O
these O
things O
are O
just O
going O
to O
cancel O
each O

out O

the O
conflict O
will O
rumble O

. O
. O
. O
. O
more O
death O

a O

And O
John B-PER
McCain I-PER
, O
the O
ever O
faithfull O
NeoCon O
servant O
, O
makes O
a O
secret O
trip O
to O

to O
meet O
the O

So O
we O
got O
Western B-LOC
Europe I-LOC
and O
the O
US B-GPE
effectively O
supporting O
Al B-ORG

/ O
Salafists O
in O
Syria B-GPE
. O

Guess O
they O
are O
only O
" O
terrorists O
" O
sometimes O
. O
. O
. O

The O
Sunni O
rebels O
have O
gone O
on O
the O
record O
to O
state O
there O
will O
be O
ethnic O
cleansing O
of O
Shia O
but O
the O
West B-LOC
supports O
them O
. O

Oh O
and O
you O
know O
there O
will O
fsdalso O
be O
ethnic O
cleansing O
of O
Christians O
because O
Christians O
are O
already O
being O
cleansed O
from O
certain O
areas O
by O
the O
Sunni O

. O

I O
agree O
and O
it O
' O
s O
all O
terribly O
depressing O
. O

So O
much O
hatred O

So O
US B-GPE
( O
and O
presumably O
to O
to O
follow O
, O
UK B-GPE
& O
amp O
; O
France B-GPE
) O
to O
arm O
the O

. O

Nerve O

Israel B-GPE
looking O

This O

has O
a O
long O

. O

The O
NATO B-ORG
- O
GCC B-ORG
- O
Israel B-GPE
axis O
thought O
Assad B-PER
was O
done O
for O
but O
with O
Hez B-ORG
' O
s O
help O
he O
routed O
the O
Sunni O
rebels O
+ O
AQ B-ORG
, O
so O
NATO B-ORG
needs O
an O
excuse O
to O
justify O
helping O
the O
Rebels O
; O
enter O
alleged O
Sarin O
use O
by O
Assad B-PER
. O

If O
ever O
there O
was O
a O
sentence O
to O
chill O
the O
blood O
- O
that O
was O
it O
( O
except O
you O
didn O
' O
t O
mention O
Russia B-GPE
) O
. O

So O
you O
agree O
( O
mostly O
) O
or O
disagree O
with O
what O
I O
said O
? O

Russia B-GPE
doesn O
' O
t O
appear O
to O
be O
helping O
Assad B-PER
to O
the O
extent O
the O
aforementioned O
3 O
are O
helping O
the O
Rebels O
; O
they O
deny O
sending O
the O
S300 O
. O

The O
major O
Russian B-GPE
help O
( O
along O
with O
China B-GPE
) O
appears O
limited O
to O
supporting O
Assad B-PER
in O
the O
UN B-ORG
. O

It O
' O
s O
Dr O
kelly B-PER
all O
over O
again O

Whatever O
happens O
we O
can O
be O
sure O
we O
' O

be O
blamed O
by O
liberals O
, O
fundamentalists O
and O
whoever O
else O
already O
hates O
us O
. O

N B-PER

It O
' O
s O
not O
in O
Israel B-GPE
' O
s O
interests O
to O
see O
the O
Assad B-PER
Government O
fall O
. O

A O
stable O
and O
secular O
Syria B-GPE
would O
eventually O
come O
to O
the O
table O
with O
them O
( O
especially O
once O
Iran B-GPE
moderates O
) O
. O

N B-PER

I O
too O
think O
Israel B-GPE
would O
be O
worse O
off O
with O
the O
Salafi O
Saudi B-GPE
/ O
Qatari B-GPE

BUT O
it O
does O
appear O
that O

similar O
to O
Pope O

promoted O
peace O
and O
were O
able O
to O
bring O

just O

that O

' O

did O
not O
link O
to O

so O
they O
could O

iFuneral O
. O

Oh O
c O
' O
mon O
, O
Mandela B-PER
would O
never O
do O
that O
since O
he O
cleaned O
up O
his O
act O
. O

If O
you O
did O
disagree O
with O
his O
policies O
he O
would O
do O
nothing O
more O
than O
shake O
your O
hand O
and O
secretly O
order O
a O
7 O
- O
year O
tax O
audit O
on O
your O
non O
- O
profit O
organization O
, O
like O
he O
did O
with O
Dr O
. O
Peter B-PER
Hammond I-PER
. O

I O
was O
under O
the O
impression O
he O
used O
Android O
. O

Incorrect O
. O

Mandela B-PER
said O
that O
there O
is O
" O
no O
alternative O
to O
armed O
and O
violent O
resistance O
" O
and O
helped O
organize O
the O
ANC B-ORG
into O
a O
cell O
structure O
to O
facilitate O
persistent O
violence O
. O

Over O
the O
years O
, O
the O
ANC B-ORG
was O
involved O
in O
the O
deaths O
of O
thousands O
. O

This O
went O
on O
for O
thirty O
years O
, O
during O
which O
time O
Mandela B-PER
somehow O
convinced O
a O
bunch O
of O
people O
he O
was O
a O
man O
of O
peace O
. O

Now O
a O
person O
could O
well O
come O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
violence O
was O
justified O
against O
apartheid O
( O
or O
communism O
for O
that O
matter O
) O
. O

However O
, O
the O
point O
remains O
that O
Mandela B-PER
was O
a O
man O
of O
violence O
, O
nothing O
like O
JP2 B-PER
. O

I O
see O
all O
of O
the O
acts O
of O
terrorism O
that O
Mandella B-PER
engaged O
in O
that O
landed O
him O
in O
jail O
have O
been O
forgotten O
or O
just O
brushed O
aside O
. O

I O
stand O
corrected O

he O

Putin B-PER
’ O

remarks O
came O
eight O
days O
after O

arrived O
on O
an O
Aeroflot B-ORG
flight O
from O

After O
that O

it O
seemed O
that O

Sarah B-PER
Harrison I-PER
, O
a O
WikiLeaks B-ORG

who O
is O
traveling O
with O
him O

With O

evidently O
wavering O
, O
Snowden B-PER
’ O

seem O
to O

and O
his O
stopover O
at O
Sheremetyevo B-FAC

here O
now O
threatens O
to O

weeks O

Putin B-PER
referred O
to O
this O
uncertainty O
Monday O
, O
noting O
that O

apparently O
intends O
to O
keep O
publishing O
classified O
documents O
that O
damage O
the O
United B-GPE

“ O
Because O
he O
sees O
himself O
as O

apparently O
he O

“ O

he O

According O
to O

A O
Foreign B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
official O
told O
The O

Times O
on O
Monday O
that O

applied O

giving O
Russian B-GPE
diplomatic O
officials O
the O

The O

characterized O
the O
applications O
as O
“ O
a O
desperate O
measure O
” O
on O

part O
, O
after O

said O
that O
the O

June O

shortly O

signaled O
openness O
to O
granting O

asylum O
, O
telling O
a O
reporter O
from O
Kommersant B-ORG
that O
“ O
if O
we O

such O
a O
request O
, O
it O
will O
be O
considered O

” O

But O
over O
the O
week O
that O
Snowden B-PER
has O
spent O
at O
Sheremetyevo B-FAC
airport I-FAC
, O
top O
Russian B-GPE
officials O
have O
tried O
to O
remain O
neutral O
on O
whether O
Snowden B-PER
should O
be O
granted O
asylum O
, O
perhaps O
because O
they O
are O
wary O
of O
the O
damage O
it O
would O
do O
to O
their O
relationship O
with O
the O
United B-GPE
States I-GPE
. O

Top O
officials O
have O
said O
the O
case O
does O
not O
directly O
involve O
them O
, O
since O
Snowden B-PER
has O
not O
passed O
through O
immigration O
control O
and O
remains O
in O
a O
part O
of O
the O
airport O
that O
is O
technically O
not O
Russian B-GPE
territory O
. O

In O
a O
radio O
interview O
Sunday O
, O
Peskov B-PER
said O
Snowden B-PER
’ O
s O
fate O
was O
“ O
not O
a O
theme O
on O
the O
Kremlin B-ORG
’ O
s O
agenda O
. O
” O

A O
series O
of O
public O
figures O
in O
Russia B-GPE
have O
come O
out O
in O
recent O
days O
in O
favor O
of O
extending O
Snowden B-PER
political O
asylum O
, O
and O
Monday O
, O
the O
question O
was O
the O
subject O
of O
a O
round O
table O
at O
the O
Public B-ORG
Chamber I-ORG
, O
a O
Kremlin B-ORG
advisory O
body O
. O

“ O
I O
believe O
that O
we O
should O
not O
give O
him O
away O
in O
any O
case O
, O
” O
said O
Alexander B-PER
Sidyakin I-PER
, O
a O
prominent O
member O
of O
the O
majority O
United B-ORG
Russia I-ORG
Party O
. O

“ O
It O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
Snowden B-PER
is O
the O
greatest O
pacifist O
. O

This O
person O
has O
done O
no O
less O
to O
win O
the O
Nobel B-PER
Peace O
Prize O
than O
Barack B-PER
Obama I-PER
. O
” O

Could O
Edward B-PER
Snowden I-PER
sail O
a O
yacht O
from O
Russia B-GPE
to O
Venezuela B-GPE
? O

A O
chartered O
flight O
that O
flew O
exclusively O
in O
international O
airspace O
between O
Russia B-GPE
and O
Venezuela B-GPE
is O
estimated O
to O
cost O
$ O
250 O
, O
000 O
. O

The O
reason O
it O
' O
s O
so O
expensive O
is O
that O
the O
trip O
is O
extremely O
difficult O
, O
at O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
range O
of O
a O
Gulfstream O
G550 O
. O

Apparently O
, O
it O
' O
s O
not O
even O
possible O
to O
do O
it O
and O
meet O
reserve O
fuel O
requirements O
. O

There O
are O
supposedly O
to O
be O
places O
the O
plane O
could O
stop O
for O
fuel O
, O
and O
have O
some O
chance O
of O
success O
. O

That O
250k O
price O
tag O
assumes O
an O
owner O
of O
one O
of O
these O
aircraft O
is O
willing O
to O
take O
the O
risk O
at O
all O
. O

According O
to O
this O
source O
, O
250k O
is O
close O
to O
the O
sticker O
price O
for O
such O
a O
trip O
normally O
. O

Anyways O
, O
another O
thing O
that O
costs O
approximately O
250k O
is O
a O
brand O
new O
, O
high O
end O
, O
ocean O
going O
yacht O
about O
40 O
feet O
long O
. O

The O
people O
helping O
Snowden B-PER
could O
purchase O
a O
used O
yacht O
of O
the O
appropriate O
size O
for O
a O
tiny O
fraction O
of O
that O
cost O
, O
and O
load O
it O
up O
with O
enough O
food O
and O
supplies O
for O
the O
journey O
. O

He O
' O
d O
leave O
in O
the O
summertime O
, O
possibly O
, O
and O
sail O
through O
the O
arctic B-LOC
on O
a O
great O
circle O
route O
past O
Scandinavia B-LOC
, O
and O
so O
forth O
, O
remaining O
in O
international O
waters O
. O

Legally O
, O
the O
yacht O
would O
be O
registered O
in O
either O
Russia B-GPE
or O
Venezuela B-GPE
. O

I O
' O
ve O
never O
sailed O
on O
the O
ocean O
, O
merely O
freshwater O
lakes O
, O
and O
I O
' O
m O
not O
certain O
how O
practical O
this O
journey O
would O
be O
. O

Late O
summer O
/ O
early O
Fall O
, O
when O
the O
arctic B-LOC
ice O
has O
melted O
happens O
to O
be O
hurricane O
season O
. O

Also O
, O
I O
' O
m O
not O
certain O
if O
enough O
of O
the O
ice O
does O
melt O
for O
such O
a O
trip O
to O
be O
made O
in O
this O
type O
of O
boat O
. O

He O
might O
have O
to O
take O
a O
route O
that O
went O
through O
the O
Mediterranean B-LOC
. O

Apparently O
, O
the O
Strait B-LOC
of I-LOC
Gibraltar I-LOC
is O
considered O
international O
waters O
. O

An O
ocean O
going O
yacht O
with O
a O
keel O
that O
is O
able O
to O
right O
itself O
after O
being O
knocked O
down O
in O
a O
storm O
is O
slow O
, O
with O
the O
longer O
ones O
being O
faster O
but O
requiring O
more O
crew O
. O

I O
' O
m O
sure O
some O
of O
the O
members O
here O
do O
have O
such O
sailing O
experience O
, O
and O
can O
tell O
me O
the O
chance O
he O
could O
make O
such O
a O
journey O
without O
having O
to O
stop O
anywhere O
along O
the O
way O
due O
to O
a O
breakdown O
or O
running O
out O
of O
supplies O
. O

Although O
, O
even O
if O
that O
happened O
, O
couldn O
' O
t O
he O
send O
an O
encrypted O
message O
to O
his O
supporters O
and O
have O
supplies O
brought O
via O
another O
boat O
to O
a O
rendevouz O
point O
in O
the O
ocean O
somewhere O
? O

And O
second O
, O
there O
must O
be O
legal O
buffs O
who O
can O
tell O
me O
if O
the O
United B-GPE
States I-GPE
could O
legally O
stop O
him O
on O
the O
journey O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
since O
yachts O
are O
so O
slow O
, O
they O
could O
readily O
stop O
him O
with O
a O
warship O
and O
place O
him O
under O
arrest O
, O
legal O
or O
not O
. O

How O
would O
the O
appropriate O
Federal O
courts O
view O
this O
kind O
of O
arrest O
? O

As O
per O
the O
second O
question O
: O
the O
US B-GPE
has O
arrested O
people O
it O
wanted O
badly O
enough O
in O
Italian B-GPE
airspace O
. O

Why O
would O
it O
be O
any O
different O
in O
international O
waters O
? O

He O
could O
go O
from O
the O
Pacific B-LOC
Coast O
of O
Russia B-GPE
and O
then O
around O
Cape B-LOC
Horn I-LOC
. O

He O
could O
also O
go O
east O
of O
NZ B-GPE
and O
Australia B-GPE
and O
then O
south O
and O
west O
and O
around O
the O
Cape B-LOC
of I-LOC
Good I-LOC
Hope I-LOC
. O

These O
routes O
would O
be O
navigationally O
very O
hard O
( O
the O
Capes O
are O
hell O
) O
in O
a O
yacht O
but O
would O
keep O
him O
in O
international O
waters O
at O
all O
times O
. O

He O
could O
go O
from O
Murmansk B-GPE
which O
is O
ice O
free O
year O
round O
but O
he O
would O
have O
to O
pass O
through O
Scandinavian B-LOC
waters O
. O

People O
sail O
around O
the O
world O
solo O
without O
stopping O
in O
races O
all O
the O
time O
, O
and O
plenty O
have O
done O
it O
in O
yachts O
no O
bigger O
than O
40 O
feet O
. O

Obviously O
he O
could O
suffer O
breakdowns O
and O
illness O
and O
accident O
but O
these O
journeys O
are O
entirely O
plausible O
if O
hazardous O
possibilities O
. O

I O
won O
' O
t O
comment O
on O
whether O
the O
US B-GPE
could O
legally O
stop O
him O
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
doubt O
the O
US B-GPE
might O
stop O
him O
, O
and O
I O
don O
' O
t O
doubt O
they O
could O
do O
so O
if O
they O
knew O
he O
was O
doing O
it O
. O

If O
Russia B-GPE
sent O
him O
on O
his O
way O
and O
if O
( O
if O
) O
they O
kept O
the O
whole O
thing O
quiet O
it O
could O
be O
that O
the O
US B-GPE
would O
never O
come O
to O
hear O
about O
the O
journey O
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
know O
if O
Norway B-GPE
has O
any O
regular O
program O
of O
stopping O
and O
searching O
private O
yachts O
coming O
through O
their O
waters O
. O

They O
may O
well O
not O
. O

Once O
he O
was O
through O
into O
the O
Atlantic B-LOC
international O
waters O
, O
there O
is O
no O
regular O
program O
of O
stopping O
and O
searching O
yachts O
as O
far O
as O
I O
know O
. O

So O
it O
is O
entirely O
conceivable O
he O
could O
just O
sail O
out O
of O
Murmansk B-GPE
and O
not O
touch O
land O
or O
make O
contact O
with O
anyone O
till O
he O
makes O
landfall O
in O
Venezuala B-GPE

any O

that O

there O
have O
been O
people O
drawing O
down O
their O
accounts O
to O
almost O
nothing O

But O
this O
started O
well O
before O
the O
Cypress B-GPE
issue O
. O

I O
guess O
the O
awake O
people O
haven O
' O
t O
told O
the O
sheeple O
. O

I O
would O
also O
say O
that O
there O
is O
a O
type O
of O
run O
on O
banks O
and O
it O
has O
been O
going O
on O
for O
a O
while O
. O

Cypress B-GPE
is O
not O
doing O
this O
: O

Of O
course O
that O
' O
s O
for O
now O

Whether O
or O
not O
this O
happens O
in O
Cyprus B-GPE
or O
not O
, O
it O
will O
happen O
sooner O
or O
later O
probably O
in O
many O
nations O
world O
wide O
. O

As O
its O
been O
said O
many O
times O
, O
" O
Give O
a O
man O
a O

he O
can O
rob O
a O

, O
Give O
a O

a O

he O
can O

the O

" O

Yes O
, O
they O
voted O
it O
down O
after O
the O
people O
gave O
them O
loud O
feedback O
. O

But O
the O
issue O
is O
that O
they O
even O
thought O
of O
it O
. O

That O
the O
EU B-GPE
wanted O
it O
. O

I O
think O
that O
many O
of O
the O
people O
have O
lost O
a O
lot O
of O
trust O
in O
their O
government O
for O
bringing O
it O
up O
and O
have O
lost O
faith O
in O
the O
banks O
as O
a O
safe O
haven O
for O
their O
savings O
. O

When O
the O
banks O
open O
I O
would O
not O
be O
surprised O
to O
see O
a O

. O

Now O

The O

Cyprus B-GPE

I O
can O
tell O
you O
that O

. O

You O
ask O
why O
the O
enviroweenies O
dont O
complain O
about O
China B-GPE
. O
. O
. O
it O
is O
because O
they O
are O
not O
given O
a O

so O
. O

There O
is O
no O
freedom O
of O

in O
Communist O
China B-GPE
. O
. O
. O
dont O
let O
the O

The O

I O
cringe O
whenever O
I O
hear O
the O
idiots O
in O
this O
country O
pontificate O
that O
the O
US B-GPE
must O
strive O
to O
be O
more O
like O

( O
I O
have O
traveled O
there O
extensively O

also O
) O
, O
or O
places O
like O
China B-GPE
. O

Wow O
, O
with O

that O
dense O
you O
would O
think O
it O
would O
make O
your O

We O
need O
to O
give O
Al B-PER
Gore I-PER
a O
one O

to O
China B-GPE
, O
so O
he O
can O
set O
them O
straight O
. O

Wow O
. O

Why O
aren O
' O
t O
the O
people O
dropping O
dead O
in O
the O
streets O
over O
there O
? O

Or O
maybe O
they O
are O
and O
it O
' O
s O
just O
not O
being O
reported O
. O

In O
Beijing B-GPE
the O
air O
is O
quite O
visible O
. O

It O
has O
to O
do O
with O
the O
obvious O
sources O
of O
pollution O
and O
the O
weather O
patterns O
and O
proximity O
to O
the O
desert O
to O
the O
west O
. O

Ive O
never O
seen O
the O
entire O
length O
of O
the O
wall O
surrounding O
the O
Forbidden B-FAC
City I-FAC
. O

At O
a O
distance O
of O
about O
500 O
- O
meters O
the O
perimeter O
wall O
just O
fades O
into O
the O
haze O
. O

As O
you O
travel O
west O
the O
air O
quality O
dramatically O
improves O
. O

The O
air O
in O
Chengdu B-GPE
the O
capital O
of O
Sichuan B-GPE
province O
is O
breathable O
. O

Eventually O
the O
Chinese O
will O
pay O
a O
heavy O
price O
for O
their O
carelessness O
and O
greed O
. O

But O
for O
now O
its O
all O
about O
making O
your O
fortune O
. O

Just O
like O
we O
did O
. O

Invest O
in O
the O
cheapest O
energy O
possible O
, O
then O
worry O
about O
the O
environment O
when O
you O
have O
advanced O
enough O
to O
be O
able O
to O
afford O
to O
do O
so O
. O

Imagine O
how O
bad O
it O
would O
be O
if O
they O
didn O
' O
t O
get O
rid O
of O
some O
pollution O
by O
dumping O
it O
in O
their O
exports O
! O

Problem O
with O
that O
( O
for O
them O
) O
is O
that O
when O

industrialized O
we O
had O

/ O
15th O
the O

they O

, O
and O
way O
more O
area O
to O
do O
it O
in O
. O

The O
old O
Soviet B-GPE
Union I-GPE
was O
known O
for O
their O

, O
China B-GPE

Sad O
thing O
is O
, O
you O
can O
' O

really O
blame O

Their O

that O

nothing O

" O
clothing O
if O
they O
wish O
to O
do O
so O
. O

Whilst O
this O
whole O
thing O
is O
a O
terrible O
tragedy O
it O
' O
s O
not O
cheap O
clothes O
that O
caused O
it O
it O

diabolical O

non O

I O
agree O
- O
nobody O
is O
forced O
to O
buy O
cheap O
clothes O
. O

Where O
' O
s O
the O
blame O
on O
the O
Bangledeshi B-GPE
government O
/ O
authorities O
in O
all O

? O

Primark B-ORG

factory O
in O

. O

What O
cost O
those O
GBPeso1 O
t O
- O
shirts O
? O

A O
few O
things O
to O
understand O
: O
The O
population O
of O
Bangladesh B-GPE
is O
160m O
in O
an O
area O
smaller O
than O
that O
of O
Victoria B-GPE
. O

It O
' O
s O
basically O
all O
around O
sea O
level O
, O
and O
gets O
hit O
by O
monsoon O
and O
typoon O
. O

Everyone O
except O
the O
1 O
% O
are O
extremely O
poor O
, O
all O
agencies O
are O
corrupt O
, O
and O
realistically O
, O
people O
are O
disposable O
. O

Actually O
it O
' O
s O
more O
than O
that O
, O
people O
are O
a O
problem O
. O

When O
China B-GPE
was O
in O
the O
early O
stage O
of O
growth O
it O
took O
many O
of O
the O
clothes O
manufacturing O
contracts O
from O
Bangladesh B-GPE
, O
depressing O
the O
industry O
and O
the O
economy O
and O
closing O
factories O
. O

Now O
they O
have O
moved O
on O
to O
making O
high O
value O
goods O
, O
those O
contracts O
are O
moving O
back O
, O
and O
factories O
are O
being O
expanded O
to O
cope O
. O

Couple O
the O
corruption O
, O
the O
growth O
and O
the O
disposable O
populous O
, O
and O
people O
will O
get O
crammed O
into O
the O
cheapest O
building O
, O
themselves O
built O
by O
the O
cheapest O
workers O
- O
and O
everyone O
will O
skim O
from O
the O
top O
, O
bottom O
and O
sides O
. O

' O
Standards O
' O
, O
whether O
Bangladesh B-GPE
government O
, O
western B-LOC
brand O
labels O
, O
or O
factory O
owner O
- O
are O
unlikely O
to O
make O
much O
difference O
, O
even O
if O
they O
were O
raised O
- O
someone O
would O
skim O
money O
off O
by O
doing O
a O
cheap O
job O
and O
swearing O
blind O
they O
had O
done O
everything O
to O
standard O
. O

If O
you O
took O
the O
contracts O
away O
, O
you O
' O
d O
just O
have O
more O
workers O
starving O
and O
out O
of O
work O
. O

Some O
excellent O
points O
here O
. O

Also O
, O
it O
' O
s O
worth O
remembering O
that O
the O
terrible O
conditions O
described O
in O
Bangladesh B-GPE
were O
experienced O
by O
British B-GPE
workers O
during O
the O
industrial O
revolution O
, O
as O
Britain B-GPE

to O

Why O
was O
Nokia B-ORG
reluctant O
to O
adopt O
Android O
? O

Think O
about O
it O
, O
why O
didn O
' O
t O
Nokia B-ORG
switch O
to O
Android O
? O

They O
probably O
wouldn O
' O
t O
in O
their O
current O
position O
if O
they O
chose O
to O
adopt O
Android O
. O

Partnering O
with O
Microsoft B-ORG
isn O
' O
t O
that O
fruitful O
from O
the O
looks O
of O
it O
. O

Just O
imagine O
the O
Nokia B-ORG
Lumia O
920 O
but O
with O
Android O
, O
that O
would O
be O
really O
sexy O
. O

Microsoft B-ORG
gave O
them O
quite O
a O
bit O
of O
money O
, O
so O
there O
you O
have O
it O
. O

I O
agree O
with O
you O
though O
. O

Windows O
Phone O
is O
awful O
. O

Mr O
Elop B-PER
. O

A O
modern O

Microsoft B-ORG
Trojan O
horse O
. O

I O
' O
m O
sure O
over O
time O
things O
will O
sort O
themselves O
out O
but O
Nokia B-ORG
have O
fallen O
way O
behind O
from O
their O
once O
dominant O
position O
. O

I O
' O
d O
buy O
Nokia B-ORG
Android O
hardware O
in O
a O
heartbeat O
and O
do O
think O
their O
Lumia O
line O
of O
smartphones O
are O
great O
, O
Windows O
Phone O
included O

Once O
the O
WP O
ecosystem O
picks O
up O
, O
Nokia B-ORG
will O
be O
the O
premier O
Windows O
Phone O
OEM O
. O

HTC B-ORG
, O
Samsung B-ORG
, O
ZTE B-ORG
and O
Huawei B-ORG
can O
' O
t O
compete O
with O
Nokia B-ORG
engineering O
. O

Nokia B-ORG
didn O
' O
t O
need O
Android O
, O
much O
less O
Windows O
. O

They O
needed O
SOMETHING O
. O

They O
were O
losing O
money O
either O
way O
. O

But O
agreed O
with O
the O
second O
poster O
, O
MS B-ORG
paid O
them O
to O
use O
Windows O
Phone O
instead O
of O
Android O
. O

Symbian O
was O
a O
dying O
OS O
with O
no O
hope O
left O
. O

They O
had O
been O
developing O
their O
new O
next O
generation O
OSes O
for O
years O
. O

The O
high O
end O
one O
was O
ready O
and O
with O
products O
until O
The B-ORG
Destroyer I-ORG
ruined O
everything O
. O

The O
pittance O
MS B-ORG
money O
was O
no O
reason O
. O

Now O
Nokia B-ORG
pays O
more O
in O
licenses O
and O
they O
have O
made O
a O
lot O
of O
patent O
usage O
gifts O
. O

They O
were O
not O
losing O
money O
when O
they O
decided O
to O
go O
for O
Windows O
. O

Sales O
were O
up O
, O
profits O
were O
up O
, O
ASP O
was O
up O
. O

So O
much O
FUD O
and O
hatred O
, O
really O
guys O
? O

It O
' O
s O
because O
of O
2 O
factors O

If O
Nokia B-ORG
went O

Microsoft B-ORG
needed O
a O
partner O
, O
and O
was O
willing O
to O
pay O
$ O
$ O
$ O

Personally O
I O
think O
it O
worked O
out O
pretty O
well O
for O

as O
they O

Interestingly O
enough O
, O
the O
only O

is O
another O
company O
that O
went O
Android O
and O
had O
it O
not O
work O
out O
- O
HTC B-ORG
. O

I O
suppose O
they O
could O
have O
continued O
development O
on O

it O
was O
doomed O

He O
said O

its O

that O

Interested O
in O

I O
' O

I O
like O
the O
idea O

in O

we O

we O
see O

He O
for O

PS O

Clearly O
a O
traitor O
. O

Also O
a O
complete O
Hypocrite O
to O
seek O
shelter O
in O
countries O
that O
have O
worse O
snooping O
, O
secrecy O
and O
spying O
records O
than O
the O
country O
he O
just O
left O
behind O
and O
is O
complaining O
about O
. O

Makes O
me O
wonder O
just O
how O
genuine O
are O
his O
motives O
or O
if O
there O
is O
a O
bit O
more O
to O
it O
than O
meets O
the O
eye O
. O

Yes O
, O
Traitor O
. O

Matters O
not O
which O
country O
he O
came O
from O
. O

They O
are O
all O
heavily O
involved O
in O
spying O
. O

He O
should O
rot O
in O
some O
despot O
country O
along O
with O
Assange B-PER
. O

Vile O
is O
the O
man O
who O
cannot O
love O

So O
to O
paraphrase O
the O
first O
2 O

1 O
. O

He O
IS O
Traitor O

2 O

He O
IS O
allowed O
Asylum O

OK O

if O
he O
wants O

go O

obviously O
he O

he O
knows O
something O
nobody O

does O
and O
doesn O
' O
t O
know O
the O
background O
of O

he O
seems O
so O
desperate O
to O
drop O
anchor O
. O

I O
just O
can O
' O
t O
understand O
why O
he O

to O
suddenly O
popped O
up O
out O

nowhere O
( O
so O
far O
as O
we O
are O

it O
is O
usual O
for O

to O
show O
signs O

drifting O
" O
from O

and O
been O
subject O
to O
more O

more O
security O
reviews O
with O
his O
access O

restricted O
to O
nothing O

his O

indicates O
he O

a O
history O

finishing O
things O
he O

bending O
the O
truth O

to O
his O

probably O
join O
the O

if O
not O
already O

Probably O
find O
he O

a O
Walter O

although O
he O
has O
sent O
the O
shivers O
up O

that O

On O

Our O

when O
compared O

If O

I O

they O
' O
d O
bail O

For O
a O

I O
think O
our O

would O
probably O
now O
do O
a O
half O

to O
the O
post O

. O

Looting O
turns O
deadly O
as O
typhoon O
aid O
efforts O
spur O
desperation O

I O
can O
see O
looting O
in O
this O
situation O
- O
- O
- O
for O
food O
, O
water O
, O
and O
medicine O
in O
the O
face O
of O
devastation O
and O
starvation O
. O

I O
think O
that O
looting O
is O
a O
cultural O
thing O
. O

In O
Japan B-GPE
, O
when O
there O
was O
the O
last O
major O
disaster O
, O
there O
was O
virtually O
NO O
looting O
. O

People O
there O
are O
law O
abiding O
, O
respectful O
, O
humble O
, O
hard O
working O
and O
have O
little O
or O
no O
sense O
of O
entitlement O
. O

Here O
in O
AmeriKA B-GPE
, O
bottom O
feeding O
cretins O
take O
every O
opportunity O
available O
to O
seize O
a O
big O
screen O
TV O
, O
computer O
, O
major O
appliance O
, O
bling O
or O
anything O
of O
marketable O
value O
. O

Disasters O
bring O
out O
the O
best O
and O
worst O
in O
people O
. O

Would O
I O
loot O
to O
feed O
myself O
and O
my O
family O
in O
the O
face O
of O
starvation O
and O
civil O
breakdown O
with O
no O
indication O
that O
help O
is O
on O
the O
way O
- O
- O
- O
you O
bet O
. O

I O
honestly O
can O
' O
t O
say O
what O
I O
' O
d O
do O
in O
that O
situation O
as O
thankfully O
, O
I O
' O
ve O
never O
been O
in O
one O
similar O
. O

However O
, O
I O
can O
say O
that O
PRIOR O
to O
such O
a O
disaster O
happening O
, O
I O
prepare O
, O
not O
just O
for O
typhoons O
, O
but O
for O
every O
imaginable O
" O
realistic O
" O
scenario O
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
want O
to O
be O
in O
a O
position O
where O
I O
' O
m O
desperate O
enough O
to O
loot O
others O
who O
took O
the O
time O
/ O
energy O
TO O
prepare O
, O
whereas O
I O
did O
not O
. O

And O
kudos O
to O
the O
Japanese O
for O
their O
integrity O
. O

I O
' O
m O
not O
exactly O
convinced O
it O
' O
s O
a O
cultural O
thing O
, O
desperate O
people O
do O
desperate O
things O
no O
matter O
what O
their O
coordinates O
are O
. O

Whether O
rich O
or O
poor O
, O
black O
or O
white O
( O
or O
Japanese O
) O
. O

I O
base O
my O
“ O
cultural O
comments O
” O
on O
the O
fact O
that O
there O
are O
two O
different O
situations O
pertaining O
to O
" O
looting O
. O
" O

Looting O
, O
when O
your O
city O
has O
been O
flattened O
, O
everyone O
is O
homeless O
, O
nothing O
is O
left O
standing O
, O
everybody O
is O
starving O
is O
one O
thing O
. O

Looting O
because O
someone O
beat O
up O
someone O
, O
something O
like O
the O
Travon B-PER
Martin I-PER
case O
happens O
, O
or O
some O
other O
" O
grievance O
" O
occurs O
certainly O
does O
not O
rise O
to O
the O
level O
of O
what O
you O
see O
in O
a O
disaster O
. O

My O
point O
is O
that O
there O
are O
people O
who O
look O
for O
an O
opportunity O
to O
loot O
without O
regard O
for O
the O
magnitude O
of O
a O
disaster O
or O
even O
the O
presence O
of O
one O
. O

When O
I O
see O
someone O
on O
a O
sunny O
day O
in O
the O
land O
of O
opportunity O
and O
prosperity O
and O
the O
deluxe O
safety O
hammock O
running O
out O
of O
a O
store O
with O
a O
big O
screen O
TV O
, O
the O
only O
excuse O
that O
comes O
to O
mind O
for O
me O
is O
that O
it O
is O
a O
cultural O
thing O
. O

Most O
decent O
people O
do O
not O
loot O
other O
people O
’ O
s O
stuff O
. O

Period O
. O

Can O
' O
t O
argue O
with O
that O
logic O
. O

We O
certainly O
are O
the O
land O
of O
" O
opportunity O
" O
. O

Agreed O
, O
the O
problem O
in O
the O
PI B-GPE
is O
the O
disparity O
between O
the O
corrupt O
gub O
officials O
and O
the O
average O
citizen O
. O

Remember O
there O
is O
no O
middle O
class O
there O
. O

The O
average O
Filipino O
is O
living O
almost O
at O
a O
subsistence O
level O
already O
and O
throw O
in O
a O
super O
typhoon O
, O
it O
will O
definitely O
bring O
out O
the O
worst O
in O
people O
. O

Its O
not O
hard O
to O
imagine O
that O
we O
might O
be O
headed O
down O
this O
very O
path O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
Japan B-GPE
, O
they O
are O
a O
cultural O
anamoly O
. O

I O
guess O
it O
could O
be O
their O
isolationist O
nature O
or O
strong O
sense O
of O
honor O
/ O
bushido O
but O
personally O
i O
think O
they O
handle O
their O
disasters O
, O
natural O
or O
other O
wise O
very O
well O
. O

Apple B-ORG
Outfoxed O
By O
Foxconn B-ORG
Smartwatch O
? O

I O
thought O
Foxconn B-ORG
Worked O
for O
Apple B-ORG
? O

They O
announced O
a O
new O
Foxconn B-ORG
smartwatch O
today O
. O
. O
. O
just O
before O
Apple B-ORG
is O
supposed O
to O
release O
the O
iWatch O

It O
looks O
more O
like O
a O
Nike B-ORG
Fuelband O
, O
but O
I O
can O
' O
t O
believe O
that O
Apple B-ORG
is O
too O
happy O
about O
this O
. O

Maybe O
they O
did O
it O
because O
Apple B-ORG
is O
moving O
manufacturing O
back O
home O
to O
the O
US B-GPE
. O

Not O
exclusively O
no O
. O

Foxconn B-ORG
is O
, O
more O
aptly O
, O
a O
supplier O
( O
parts O
and O
labor O
) O
to O
Apple B-ORG
. O

Samsung B-ORG
is O
also O
a O
supplier O
( O
memory O
chips O
) O
to O
Apple B-ORG
. O

1 O
. O

That O
looks O
just O
like O
the O
Microsoft B-ORG
watch O
dumped O
after O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
. O

Apple B-ORG
' O
s O
offering O
is O
rumored O
to O
have O
a O
flexible O
display O
. O

2 O
. O

IMO O
, O
the O
rumored O
iWatch O
may O
turn O
out O
to O
be O
a O
smoke O
screen O
. O

Foxconn B-ORG
is O
a O
manufacturing O
company O
, O
they O
have O
multiple O
contractors O
including O
Apple B-ORG
, O
Samsung B-ORG
and O
Sony B-ORG
. O

You O
also O
realize O
that O
different O
parts O
of O
companies O
do O
different O
things O
, O
right O
? O

Samsung B-ORG
supplies O
displays O
to O
Apple B-ORG
but O
also O
makes O
cell O
phones O
, O
Apple B-ORG
isn O
' O
t O
cutting O
ties O
with O
them O
for O
this O
, O
nor O
should O
they O
. O

I O
know O
. O
. O
. O
but O
I O
assume O
they O
would O
have O
some O
sort O
of O
non O
compete O
agreement O
. O

Apple B-ORG
doesn O
' O
t O
make O
a O
watch O
. O

You O
are O
suggesting O
they O
have O
an O
agreement O
in O
place O
that O
prevents O
Foxconn B-ORG
/ O
Hon B-ORG
Hai I-ORG
from O
making O
anything O
that O
Apple B-ORG
might O
make O
in O
the O
future O
at O
some O
point O
. O

To O
me O
that O
sounds O
ridiculous O
. O

If O
the O
Smartfitty O
watch O
shown O
in O
the O
video O
is O
what O
you O
' O
re O
talking O
about O
, O
then O
it O
doesn O
' O
t O
impress O
me O
at O
all O
, O
and O
neither O
Apple B-ORG
nor O
Google B-ORG
have O
anything O
to O
worry O
about O
. O

I O
say O
this O
as O
an O
owner O
of O
a O
Pebble B-ORG
Smartwatch O
, O
the O
only O
true O
smart O
watch O
out O
there O
. O

Ooops O
. O
. O
. O
you O
' O
re O
right O
. O

I O
posted O
the O
wrong O
link O
. O
. O
. O

I O
fixed O
it O
now O
. O

I O
wasn O
' O
t O
discussing O
the O
SmartFitty O
, O
I O
was O
discussing O
the O
Foxconn B-ORG
entry O
. O

It O
just O
seems O
odd O
that O
they O
are O
now O
transitioning O
from O
a O
supply O
company O
for O
others O
to O
making O
their O
own O
products O
. O

Even O
more O
than O
ridiculous O
. O

It O
' O
s O
nonsensical O
. O

Nobody O
would O
be O
able O
to O
partner O
with O
anybody O
since O
any O
company O
can O
potentially O
get O
into O
any O
market O
segment O
at O
any O
time O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
Apple B-ORG
and O
Samsung B-ORG
are O
partners O
( O
in O
that O
Apple B-ORG
buys O
components O
from O
Samsung B-ORG
) O
means O
that O
no O
such O
agreement O
exists O
. O

According O

( O

in O
a O
story O
also O
picked O
up O
by O

A O

quoted O

opining O

" O

expecting O

the O

would O
be O
in O

a O
possibility O
that O

become O
a O
large O

might O
bring O

to O
the O

of O

I O

The O

High I-ORG
Court I-ORG
ruled O
Thursday O
that O
Nokia B-ORG
would O
be O
allowed O
to O
transfer O
a O
phone O
factory O
to O
Microsoft B-ORG
, O
clearing O
a O
major O

4 O
billion O
sale O
of O

ordered O

to O
set O
aside O
$ O
365 O
million O
for O
potential O

The O
factory O
, O
in O
the O
southern O
city O
of O
Chennai B-GPE
, O
is O
one O
of O
Nokia B-ORG
’ O
s O
largest O
handset O
manufacturing O
plants O
and O
was O
seized O
along O
with O
its O
other O
Indian B-GPE
assets O
in O
September O
by O
the O
Indian B-GPE
tax O
authorities O
because O
of O
a O
tax O
dispute O
with O
the O
Indian B-GPE
government O
. O

Nokia B-ORG
had O
asked O
to O
have O
the O
seizure O
repealed O
by O
Thursday O
. O

However O
, O
Nokia B-ORG
’ O
s O
tax O
battle O
with O
India B-GPE
continues O
. O

In O
March O
, O
the O
Indian B-GPE
government O
presented O
the O
local O
unit O
of O
Nokia B-ORG
with O
a O
bill O
of O
about O
$ O
340 O
million O
in O
back O
taxes O
over O
five O
fiscal O
years O
. O

“ O
It O
is O
a O
positive O
move O
forward O
that O
Nokia B-ORG
has O
been O
allowed O
to O
go O
through O
with O
its O
asset O
sale O
, O
” O
said O
Dinesh B-PER
Kanabar I-PER
, O
the O
deputy O
chief O
executive O
of O
KPMG B-ORG
India I-ORG
. O

“ O
It O
was O
worrisome O
that O
a O
hypothetical O
demand O
from O
the O
Indian B-GPE
tax O
office O
was O
becoming O
a O
barrier O
to O
a O
global O
transaction O
. O
” O

He O
added O
that O
it O
was O
unclear O
what O
Nokia B-ORG
’ O
s O
ultimate O
tax O
liability O
would O
be O
, O
and O
that O
the O
matter O
would O
be O
decided O
by O
tax O
tribunals O
and O
the O
Indian O
courts O
. O

Kanabar B-PER
, O
who O
spoke O
with O
Harish B-PER
Salve I-PER
, O
the O
lawyer O
representing O
Nokia B-ORG
, O
said O
the O
Delhi B-ORG
High I-ORG
Court I-ORG
asked O
Nokia B-ORG
Finland I-ORG
to O
deposit O
the O
$ O
365 O
million O
with O
India B-GPE
’ O
s O
tax O
department O
in O
an O
escrow O
account O
as O
interim O
payment O
. O

But O
the O
court O
also O
said O
the O
amount O
could O
increase O
if O
the O
company O
’ O
s O
local O
assets O
were O
assessed O
to O
be O
of O
a O
higher O
value O
. O

The O
court O
clarified O
that O
once O
Nokia B-ORG
completed O
the O
sale O
of O
the O
Chennai B-GPE
factory O
to O
Microsoft B-ORG
, O
the O
new O
owner O
would O
not O
be O
liable O
to O
pay O
Nokia B-ORG
’ O
s O
tax O
bill O
; O
that O
would O
fall O
to O
what O
remains O
of O
Nokia B-ORG
after O
the O
sale O
of O
its O
handset O
business O
. O

Officials O
from O
the O
Indian B-GPE
tax O
department O
declined O
to O
comment O
on O
the O
ruling O
. O

Nokia B-ORG
, O
which O
expects O
to O
close O
the O
sale O
of O
its O
handset O
division O
to O
Microsoft B-ORG
early O
next O
year O
, O
said O
it O
was O
studying O
the O
court O
’ O
s O
ruling O
and O
how O
it O
would O
affect O
any O
future O
tax O
payment O
to O
the O
Indian B-GPE
government O
. O

“ O
In O
recent O
months O
we O
have O
seen O
and O
read O
about O
many O
claims O
from O
the O
tax O
authorities O
, O
” O
Nokia B-ORG
said O
in O
a O
statement O
Thursday O
. O

“ O
We O
feel O
they O
are O
without O
merit O
and O
will O
defend O
ourselves O
vigorously O
in O
court O
. O
” O

Several O
foreign O
companies O
like O
Vodafone B-ORG
, O
Royal B-ORG
Dutch I-ORG
Shell I-ORG
and O
IBM B-ORG
are O
also O
embroiled O
in O
tax O
disputes O
with O
the O
Indian B-GPE
government O
. O

The O
Indian B-GPE
government O
’ O
s O
retroactive O
application O
of O
tax O
laws O
and O
efforts O
to O
collect O
back O
taxes O
have O
made O
foreign O
companies O
wary O
of O
setting O
up O
operations O
in O
India B-GPE
. O

“ O
Foreign O
investors O
have O
become O
concerned O
with O
the O
vagaries O
of O
Indian B-GPE
tax O
laws O
and O
the O
aggressive O
interpretation O
of O
tax O
laws O
by O
the O
income O
tax O
department O
, O
” O
Kanabar B-PER
said O
. O

“ O
When O
India B-GPE
’ O
s O
finance B-ORG
minister O
goes O
on O
road O
shows O
abroad O
, O
these O
concerns O
are O
often O
voiced O
. O
” O

Sign O
of O
something O
big O
? O

Russia B-GPE
is O
evacuating O
citizens O
from O
Syria B-GPE
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O

If O
anybody O
knows O
what O
' O
s O
happening O
over O
there O
, O
it O
' O
s O
probably O
the O
Russkies O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O

Makes O
you O
wonder O
whats O
going O
on O
. O

Thanks O
for O
sharing O
! O

Uhm O
, O
its O
obvious O
to O
me O
, O
Al B-ORG
CIAda I-ORG
has O
been O
tooled O
to O
overthrow O
the O
place O
. O
. O
. O
just O
like O
happened O
in O
Libya B-GPE
. O
. O
. O
seems O
to O
me O
they O
are O
failing O
at O
it O
this O
time O
. O

No O
, O
their O
just O
worried O
their O
people O
or O
government O
employees O
could O
be O
harmed O

Ok O
, O
so O
they O
move O
100 O
people O
. O

Business O
as O
usual O
for O
the O
other O
39 O
, O
900 O

Glass O
Parking O
lot O
time O
? O

They O
got O
tired O
of O
the O
" O
repatriation O
" O
expenses O
from O
all O
the O
inbreeding O
? O

RUSSIA B-GPE
knows O
something O
is O
a O
coming O
. O

Like O
in O
complete O
HOUSECLEANING O
. O

Only O
thing O
that O
surprises O
me O
is O
that O
they O
waited O
this O
long O

ok O
I O
thought O
I O
had O
heard O
that O
the O
head O
guy O
in O
Syria B-GPE
was O
now O
living O
on O
a O
ship O
out O
at O
sea O
and O
transporting O
back O
and O
forth O
via O
helicopter O
for O
state O
meetings O
etc O
. O

I O
also O
thought O
it O
was O
a O
russian B-GPE
protected O
ship O
he O
was O
staying O
on O
. O
. O
. O

I O
remember O
that O
because O
I O
thought O
of O
them O
using O
bio O
/ O
chem O
warfare O
on O
their O
own O
people O
to O
win O
the O
civil O
war O
going O
on O
over O
there O
. O

I O
thought O
the O
only O
thing O
stopping O
him O
from O
unleashing O
something O
really O
nasty O
would O
be O
him O
staying O
there O
. O

Once O
he O
was O
gone O
he O
could O
unleash O
anything O
he O
wanted O
, O
and O
then O
go O
back O
to O
what O
ever O
was O
left O
when O
it O
was O
done O
. O

If O
they O
' O
re O
evacuating O
the O
russians O
it O
would O
make O
me O
think O
they O
are O
at O
that O
breaking O
point O
where O
they O
are O
going O
to O
do O
something O
really O
nasty O
and O
want O
to O
minimize O
the O
casualties O
of O
their O
allies O
. O

It O
might O
not O
be O
a O
bio O
/ O
chem O
attack O
, O
but O
it O
will O
be O
mighty O
bloody O
nasty O
either O
way O
. O

I O
doubt O
they O
would O
" O
turn O
it O
to O
glass O
" O
because O
in O
the O
end O
, O
they O
still O
want O
control O
of O
the O
land O
, O
and O
they O
wouldn O
' O
t O
want O
it O
useless O
. O
. O
. O

All O
that O
being O
said O
, O
I O
didn O
' O
t O
fact O
check O
any O
of O
it O
, O
and O
I O
very O
well O
may O
have O
things O
confused O
. O

It O
' O
s O
not O
something O
I O
dug O
into O
, O
just O
something O
I O
remember O
reading O
a O
week O
or O
so O
ago O
. O

Forgive O
me O
if O
I O
got O
that O
wrong O
. O
. O
. O

Either O
way O
, O
it O
doesn O
' O
t O
sound O
good O
for O
syria B-GPE
. O

Well O
, O
if O
we O
believe O
all O
the O
news O
that O
Syria B-GPE
loaded O
the O
chemical O
weapons O
onto O
the O
missiles O
or O
whatever O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O
and O
that O
was O
on O
Dec O
5 O
, O
2012 O
. O

Again O
, O
supposedly O
, O
they O
have O
a O
shelf O
life O
of O
60 O
days O
once O
loaded O
. O

So O
, O
again O
, O
if O
we O
believe O
in O
this O
scenario O
, O
then O
the O
end O
of O
the O
60 O
days O
would O
put O
around O
Feb O
5 O
, O
2013 O
. O

So O
, O
in O
theory O
, O
they O
have O
to O
be O
used O
within O
the O
next O
13 O
days O
. O

Again O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O
if O
any O
/ O
part O
/ O
all O
of O
it O
is O
true O
. O

Maybe O
that O
is O
part O
of O
the O
reason O
for O
the O
above O
news O
story O
. O

Who O
knows O
. O

More O
than O
likely O
nothing O
will O
happen O
. O

The O
SYRIAN B-GPE
house O
cleaning O
goes O
on O
to O
the O
next O
stage O
. O

The O
Russians O
learned O
their O
lesson O
in O
Afganistan B-GPE
. O

I O
imagine O
the O
next O
biggie O
, O
they O
' O
ll O
just O
bomb O
the O
hell O
out O
of O
it O
with O
no O
ground O
troops O
. O

LOL O
! O

Check O
out O
the O
unibrow O
on O
the O
guy O
, O
second O
back O
on O
the O
right O
. O
. O
. O

WE O
should O
have O
learned O
the O
lesson O
from O
the O
Russians O
in O
Afganistan B-GPE
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
we O
didn O
' O
t O
. O

They O
found O
another O
Leo B-PER
Tolstoy I-PER
epic O
. O

This O
is O
an O
interesting O
thread O
/ O
topic O
to O
follow O
. O

Russia B-GPE
has O
always O
been O
the O
" O
sleeping O
giant O
" O
and O
I O
have O
a O
sneaky O
suspicion O
they O
will O
become O
involved O
in O
Syria B-GPE
. O

To O
what O
extent O
remains O
to O
be O
seen O
, O
but O
we O
all O
know O
Bambi B-PER
and O
( O
if O
he O
' O
s O
confirmed O
) O
Hagel B-PER
aren O
' O
t O
going O
to O
do O
crap O
. O

Combine O
this O
with O
Kerry B-PER
and O
Israel B-GPE
better O
start O
praying O
if O
they O
aren O
' O
t O
already O
. O

The O
Russians O
even O
gave O
the O
United B-GPE
States I-GPE
some O
advice O
when O
we O
first O
went O
in O
. O

Make O
it O
fast O
, O
, O
, O
and O
make O
it O
quick O
! O

Yes O
, O
today O
the O
Russian B-GPE
government O
says O
for O
no O
one O
to O
panic O
since O
it O
' O
s O
not O
an O
evacuation O
. O

Tomorrow O
they O
' O
ll O
say O
" O
Run O

Mr O
Ahmadinejad B-PER
" O

How O
convenient O
. O
. O
. O
hmm O
? O

we O
do O
the O
same O
thing O
when O
stuff O
happens O
over O

and O
evacuate O
our O
people O
who O
want O
to O
leave O
from O
hostile O
areas O

McCains B-PER
campaign O
is O
becoming O
frightening O

At O
McCain B-PER
rallies O
they O
are O
pumping O
up O
the O
crowd O
before O
McCain B-PER
and O
Palin B-PER
come O
out O
by O
trashing O
Obama B-PER
and O
calling O
him O
Husein B-PER
Obama I-PER
. O

This O
is O
followed O
by O
Palin B-PER
basically O
accusing O
him O
of O
being O
a O
terrorist O
based O
on O
his O
limited O
association O
with O
Ayers B-PER
. O

At O
one O
rally O
during O
the O
" O
terrorist O
" O
part O
of O
her O
accusations O
, O
someone O
shouted O
out O
" O
Kill O
him O
" O
to O
which O
she O
supposedly O
replied O
, O
" O
I O
want O
to O
kill O
em O
too O
" O
. O

Now O
I O
feel O
sure O
that O
if O
she O
said O
that O
, O
she O
referred O
to O
a O
victory O
in O
the O
election O
, O
but O
what O
did O
that O
redneck O
idiot O
who O
shouted O
out O
" O
Kill O
him O
" O
think O
as O
the O
crowd O
roared O
? O

This O
drumming O
up O
of O
unwarranted O
hatred O
for O
Obama B-PER
is O
dangerous O
and O
a O
sick O
picture O
of O
the O
inside O
the O
Republican B-ORG
base O
. O

It O
could O
produce O
a O
tragic O
consequence O
. O

I O
certainly O
hope O
not O
. O

Good O
article O
here O
. O

Personally O
I O
think O
she O
is O
just O
adding O
more O
nails O
to O
her O
coffin O
and O
making O
herself O
look O
a O
bloody O
racist O
idiot O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
comments O
below O
the O
brief O
article O
here O
give O
an O
idea O
what O
people O
with O
common O
sense O
think O
of O
her O
. O

There O
are O
a O
few O
in O
favor O
of O
her O
, O
and O
when O
you O
read O
them O
you O
realize O
they O
are O
from O
people O
without O
a O
lot O
of O
common O
sense O
, O
or O
brains O
. O

Like O
this O
one O

. O

YES O

I O
relate O
to O
Sarah B-PER

She O
is O
exactly O
the O

Does O
anyone O

Is O

There O
wil O
lbe O
a O
bit O
of O
belt O
tightening O
to O
start O
with O
especially O
as O
Troika O
have O
made O
a O
list O
of O
savings O
that O
have O
to O
be O
made O
. O

However O
unlike O
the O
other O
countries O
that O
have O
had O
bailouts O
, O
Cyprus B-GPE
has O
the O
newly O
discovered O
oil O
and O
gas O
reserves O
which O
in O
a O
few O
years O
will O
start O
to O
bring O
in O
big O
money O
to O
the O
island O
so O
the O
future O
is O
in O
fact O
not O
as O
bad O
as O
many O
other O
countries O
that O
are O
struggling O
. O

Thank O
you O
Veronica B-PER
for O
your O
reply O
. O

The O
oil O
and O
gas O
discovery O
is O
indeed O
promising O
and O
an O
asset O
that O
the O
other O
bailed O
out O
countries O
don O
' O
t O
have O
. O

We O
have O
lived O
abroad O
for O
many O
years O
in O
different O
countries O
and O
feel O
Cyprus B-GPE
has O
so O
much O
to O
offer O
. O

We O
look O
forward O
to O
coming O
and O
looking O
around O
! O

Kind O

I O
think O
a O
great O
deal O
will O
depend O
on O
who O
the O
next O
president O
will O
be O
. O

There O
are O
elections O
in O
the O
island O
in O
early O
February O
this O
year O
. O

Be O
a O
bit O
patient O
to O
find O
out O
what O
the O
actual O
measures O
will O
be O
. O

Nothing O
is O
finalised O
yet O
, O
and O
no O
contract O
between O
Cyprus B-GPE
and O
Troika O
has O
been O
signed O
. O

So O
nothing O
is O
certain O
yet O
about O
the O
measures O
that O
will O
follow O
. O

Thank O
you O
Prometheus B-PER
for O
your O

One O
question O
I O
forgot O
to O
mention O
was O
, O
if O
Cyprus B-GPE
has O
this O
new O
discovery O
of O
oil O
and O
gas O
, O
then O
why O
would O
they O
need O
a O
bailout O
? O

Doesn O
' O
t O
it O
seem O
to O
be O
a O
contradiction O
? O

Apparently O
the O
oil O
and O
gas O
won O
' O
t O
be O
available O
for O
domestic O
use O
until O
2016 O
, O
and O
available O
for O
export O
in O
2017 O
. O

The O
latest O
news O
is O
that O
a O
new O
President O
is O
in O
power O
and O
he O
has O
made O
the O
economy O
his O
no1 O
priority O
. O

The O
Troika O
are O
eager O
to O
resume O
talks O
with O
him O
, O
and O
he O
likewise O
. O

It O
is O
going O
to O
be O
painful O
, O
but O
as O
with O
Ireland B-GPE
, O
Cyprus B-GPE
will O
come O
out O
leaner O
and O
fitter O
. O

I O
admire O
your O
optimism O
, O
although O
I O
' O
m O
inclined O
to O
think O
it O
may O
be O
a O
little O
misplaced O
. O

We O
shall O
see O
. O

Apparently O
there O
will O
be O
nothing O
before O
May O
, O
but O
Germany B-GPE
may O
still O
block O
the O
bail O
- O
out O
unless O
we O
stop O
laundering O
Russian B-GPE
money O
here O
. O

There O
are O
very O
legitimate O
accounting O
procedures O
used O
called O
transfer O
pricing O
. O

These O
are O
acceptable O
methods O
for O
doing O
business O
. O

The O
majority O
of O
the O
transactions O
are O
genuine O
, O
but O
will O
admit O
that O
there O
may O
be O
some O

was O

The O

here O

If O
they O
did O
this O
to O
start O
off O
with O
they O
might O
have O
saved O
people O
from O
running O
on O

Its O
to O
late O
now O
they O
' O
re O
screwed O
. O

Every O
day O
, O
everyone O
is O
going O
to O
take O
out O
as O
much O
as O
they O
can O
until O
its O
all O
gone O
. O

Yes O
, O
they O
have O
avoided O
default O
. O
. O
. O
but O
at O
what O
price O
? O

So O
they O
' O
re O
not O
' O
taxing O
' O
people O
anymore O
, O
but O
they O
' O
re O
still O
going O
to O
wipe O
out O
some O

in O

It O
' O
s O
better O
than O
the O
completely O
idiotic O
wealth O
tax O
that O
was O
the O
initial O
proposal O
, O
but O
not O
appreciably O
if O
you O
happen O
to O

Instead O
of O
a O
tax O
on O

now O
the O

How O

we O

I O
think O
we O
' O
re O
using O

at O
this O
point O

All O
they O
might O
have O
done O
is O
buy O

There O

take O

that O

There O

I O
have O
a O
question O

Am O
I O
the O
only O
one O
that O
has O
been O
surprised O
by O
the O
reactions O
of O
people O
in O
the O
other O
countries O
that O
are O
in O
trouble O
? O

If O
I O
were O
in O
a O
country O
like O
Greece B-GPE
, O
Spain B-GPE
, O
Italy B-GPE
, O
or O
Portugal B-GPE
I O
would O
have O
been O
down O
that O
first O
weekend O
cleaning O
out O
my O
accounts O
. O

IF O
there O
has O
been O
a O
run O
on O

I O
have O
not O
seen O
anything O
about O
it O
posted O
anywhere O
or O
seen O
any O
news O
stories O
about O
it O
even O
on O
the O
fringe O

I O
’ O
m O
lost O
on O
this O
and O
the O
only O
things O
I O
can O
think O
are O
that O
people O
have O
lived O
so O
far O
beyond O
their O
means O
that O
they O
just O
don O
’ O
t O
have O
anything O
left O
in O
the O
banks O
or O
they O
are O
so O
oblivious O
to O
what O
is O
going O
on O
that O
they O
just O
don O
’ O
t O
care O
. O

I O
know O
around O
here O
it O
is O
the O
oblivious O
reason O
. O

We O
were O
over O
at O
our O
in O
- O
laws O
this O
weekend O
and O
asked O
them O
what O
they O
thought O
about O
what O
was O
going O
on O
and O
they O
didn O
’ O
t O
know O
a O
thing O
about O
it O
. O

Once O
we O
explained O
it O
they O
gave O
it O
a O
shrug O
and O
could O
not O
have O
cared O
less O
. O

Even O
if O
you O
buy O
into O
the O
company O
line O
that O
if O
you O
have O
less O
than O
a O
100K O
your O
money O
is O
safe O
people O
have O
to O
have O
seen O
that O
the O
last O
week O
stores O
went O
to O
cash O
only O
and O
people O
didn O
’ O
t O
have O
it O
. O

Even O
if O
you O
took O
out O
enough O
cash O
for O
a O
few O
weeks O
there O
would O
have O
been O
a O
huge O
surge O
in O
bank O
withdraws O
and O
I O
have O
not O
seen O
anything O
on O
that O
either O
. O

I O
guess O
this O
just O
supports O

saying O

That O
' O
s O
pretty O
cool O
that O
a O
CEO O
of O
a O
private O
company O
has O
the O
power O
to O
meet O
with O
world O

. O

Even O
cooler O
that O
he O
picks O
a O

that O
has O
a O

that O

I O
look O
forward O
to O
a O

Vladimir B-PER

But O
I O
would O
interpret O
it O
differently O

It O
would O
be O
an O
opportunity O
to O
spread O
Apple B-ORG

retain O

Meeting O
the O

makes O
sense O
considering O
a O

4 O

What O
creativity O
do O
you O
speak O
of O
? O

Apple B-ORG
is O
not O
about O

but O
about O
telling O
us O
it O
is O
cool O
to O
own O
an O
Apple B-ORG

Apple B-ORG

about O

I O
guess O
we O
should O
consider O
whoring O
ourselves O
to O
anyone O

including O
those O
that O
would O
house O

openly O
that O
wish O

The O
principle O
of O
what O
you O
are O
saying O
is O
sound O
( O
although O
nowadays O
the O
definition O
of O
what O
constitutes O
a O
" O
terrorist O
" O
is O
often O
very O
gray O
) O
, O
but O
we O
need O
to O
start O
making O
these O
kinds O

to O
our O

before O
we O
worry O
about O

WTF O
is O
going O
on O
in O
the O
Ukraine B-GPE

This O
is O
half O
a O
debate O

half O
a O
request O
for O
information O

I O
' O
m O
aware O
that O
there O
' O
s O
something O
of O
a O
revolution O
going O
on O
in O
the O
Ukraine B-GPE

I O
' O
m O
aware O
that O
Ukrainians O
are O
using O
both O
modern O
( O
Molotov O
) O
and O
medieval O
( O
trebuchets O
, O

) O
means O
to O
fuck O
up O
their O

But O
I O
' O
m O
not O
100 O
% O
on O
what O
' O
s O
really O
going O
on O
there O
. O

Apparently O
the O
" O
revolutionaries O
" O
want O
to O
join O
the O
EU B-GPE
- O
which O
is O
swell O
, O
except O
nobody O
asked O
them O
or O
offered O
them O
to O
. O

Also O
apparently O
the O
government O
are O
a O
bunch O
of O
fascist O
fuckwits O
( O
Go O

! O
) O

but O
judging O
from O
AFP O

hard O

I O
' O
m O
confused O

don O
' O

quite O
know O
whom O
to O
root O
for O
. O

Which O
is O
Important O
. O

Twitter O

are O
at O

. O

Can O
anybody O
shed O
some O
further O
light O
on O
what O
' O
s O
going O
on O
there O
? O

The O
president O
of O
the O
Ukraine B-GPE
is O
a O
guy O
named O
Vitor B-PER
Yanukovich I-PER
. O

When O
he O
got O
elected O
, O
he O
promised O
closer O
relations O
with O
the O
EU B-GPE
, O
even O
though O
his O
party O
, O
a O
party O
called O
the O
Party B-ORG
of I-ORG
Regions I-ORG
, O
has O
a O
reputation O
as O
being O
pro O
- O
Russian B-GPE
. O

A O
lot O
of O
Ukrainians O
support O
joining O
the O
EU B-GPE
, O
both O
because O
they O
believe O
it O
' O
ll O
help O
their O
economy O
, O
and O
because O
they O
' O
re O
worried O
about O
Russia B-GPE
, O
and O
see O
this O
as O
a O
counterbalance O
. O

So O
, O
he O
got O
elected O
in O
2010 O
, O
on O
a O
platform O
of O
closer O
ties O
to O
the O
EU B-GPE

reducing O
corruption O
, O
even O
though O
there O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
irregularities O
in O
voting O
. O

Jump O
ahead O
to O
2012 O
, O
when O
the O
EU B-GPE
and O
the O
Ukraine B-GPE
, O
as O
part O
of O
the O
EU B-GPE
' O
s O
European B-LOC
Neighborhood O
Policy O
, O
agreed O
to O
a O
framework O
for O
a O
free O
trade O
zone O
, O
but O
said O
that O
before O
it O
could O
happen O
, O
Ukraine B-GPE
would O
have O
to O
pass O
a O
bunch O
of O
reforms O
, O
including O
setting O
free O
some O
political O
prisoners O
( O
including O
a O
former O
Prime O
Minister O
) O
, O
passing O
electoral O
and O
judicial O
reform O
, O
and O
a O
bunch O
of O
other O
things O
. O

So O
, O
through O
2012 O
, O
and O
2013 O
, O
the O
Ukrainian B-GPE
parliament B-ORG
went O
forward O
, O
and O
made O
some O
legislative O
changes O
. O

While O
this O
was O
going O
on O
, O
Yanukovich B-PER
was O
also O
negotiating O
with O
Russia B-GPE
and O
Belarus B-GPE
for O
a O
customs O
union O
, O
which O
left O
the O
EU B-GPE
negotiators O
confused O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
Russia B-GPE
started O
getting O
kind O
of O
threatening O
, O
banning O
some O
Ukrainian B-GPE
products O
from O
import O
" O
for O
health O
and O
safety O
reasons O
" O
, O
being O
more O
stringent O
on O
customs O
inspections O
, O
and O
warning O
Ukraine B-GPE
that O
association O
with O
the O
EU B-GPE
would O
be O
" O
destabilizing O
" O
, O
that O
Russia B-GPE
could O
" O
no O
longer O
protect O
" O
the O
country O
in O
that O
case O
, O
and O
that O
Russia B-GPE
would O
hate O
to O
have O
to O
send O
troops O
in O
at O
the O
request O
of O
pro O
- O
Russian B-GPE
Ukrainians O
. O
. O
. O
. O
not O
that O
this O
is O
a O
threat O
. O
. O
. O
they O
' O
re O
just O
saying O
. O

So O
, O
jump O
ahead O
to O
November O
of O
2013 O
. O

The O
Ukranian B-GPE
Parliament B-ORG
was O
ready O
to O
pass O
laws O
allowing O
the O
imprisoned O
former O
Prime O
Minister O
, O
who O
' O
s O
sick O
, O
to O
travel O
to O
get O
medical O
treatment O
, O
which O
was O
one O
of O
the O
EU B-GPE
requirements O
, O
and O
the O
EU B-GPE
' O
s O
Eastern O

Summit O
in O
Vilnus B-GPE
, O
Lithuania B-GPE
was O
going O
to O
be O
held O
, O
where O
the O
treaty O
would O
be O
signed O
. O

Suddenly O
, O
the O
Parliament B-ORG
didn O
' O
t O
pass O
the O
laws O
and O
the O
government O
announced O
they O
wouldn O
' O
t O
be O
going O
to O
the O
Eastern O
Partnership O
summit O
. O

Protests O
broke O
out O
, O
really O
big O
ones O
. O

The O
Ukrainian B-GPE
government O
made O
a O
statement O
that O
they O
had O
canceled O
because O
of O
Russian B-GPE
concerns O
and O
because O
the O
deal O
was O
a O
bad O
one O
for O
the O
Ukraine B-GPE
. O

Protests O
, O
largely O
peaceful O
, O
continued O
. O

In O
December O
, O
the O
Russian B-GPE
government O
announced O
that O
it O
was O
buying O
$ O
15 O
billion O
in O
Ukrainian B-GPE
bonds O
, O
and O
it O
was O
going O
to O
reduce O
the O
cost O
of O
natural O
gas O
exports O
to O
the O
Ukraine B-GPE
. O

They O
said O
that O
there O
hadn O
' O
t O
been O
any O
talks O
yet O
about O
a O
customs O
union O
, O
but O
that O
they O
were O
still O
open O
to O
the O
possibility O
. O

The O
Ukrainian B-GPE
government O
was O
non O
- O
committal O
, O
but O
expressed O
hopes O
that O
they O
could O
have O
some O
relationship O
with O
the O
EU B-GPE
. O

Protests O
continued O
. O

The O
protesters O
, O
led O
by O
the O
opposition O
party O
, O
demanded O
the O
President O
resign O
, O
the O
government O
sign O
the O
EU B-GPE
agreement O
, O
political O
prisoners O
be O
freed O
, O
and O
the O
constitution O
be O
changed O
. O
. O

On O
January O
16 O
, O
the O
Ukrainian B-GPE
parliament B-ORG
passed O
anti O

protest O
laws O
, O
making O
it O
illegal O
to O

, O
and O
got O

. O

A O
few O
days O
later O
, O
the O
police O
charged O
the O
crowd O
, O
and O
what O
started O
as O
a O
protest O
turned O
into O
rioting O
. O

Why O
doesn O
' O

They O
' O

Why O

It O

Selective O

political O
correctness O

It O
' O

called O

No O

utter O
the O

' O

only O
' O

Which O
apparently O
allows O

The O
better O

: O

Why O
not O
? O

I O
hope O
this O

your O

Ignoring O
the O
evident O
ignorance O
of O
Mandela B-PER
' O

abjuration O
of O
violent O
protest O
during O
his O
career O
as O
expressed O
in O
this O
post O
. O
. O
. O
slinging O
the O
label O
" O
political O
correctness O
" O
is O
a O
cheap O
and O
easy O
denigration O
of O
a O
statement O
or O
position O
. O

All O
it O
means O
is O
. O
. O
. O
one O
doesn O
' O
t O
agree O

has O
no O
better O
argument O
than O
throwing O

Just O
smh O

Why O
anyone O
would O
have O
a O
problem O

this O

Thank O
you O
for O
answering O
my O
question O

You O
had O
two O
questions O
. O
. O
. O

Why O
are O
flags O
flown O
at O
half O
staff O
for O
Mandela B-PER

who O
was O
the O
last O

for O
whom O
the O
flag O
was O
flown O
at O
half O

It O
seems O
a O
bit O
disingenuous O
to O
suggest O
, O
as O
you O
did O
in O
the O
post O
above O
, O
that O
neither O
of O
your O
question O
were O
answered O

The O
first O
question O
did O
receive O
responses O

. O
. O
the O
second O
question O
answered O
later O
in O
the O
thread O

BTW O
: O
My O
understanding O
is O
the O
the O

not O

Syria B-GPE
riddle O
solved O

The O
Syrian B-GPE
war O
was O
preplanned O
and O
organised O
2 O
years O
before O
the O
' O
uprising O
' O
began O
according O
to O
former O
french B-GPE
foreign O
minister O
Roland B-PER
Dumas I-PER
: O

In O
the O
video O
, O
he O
says O
the O
british B-GPE
government O
( O
US B-GPE
lackey O
) O
officials O
approached O
him O
to O
participate O
in O
the O
overthrow O
of O
the O
assad B-PER
government O
because O
of O
his O
firm O
stance O
against O
israel B-GPE
. O

In O
fact O
, O
at O
the O
end O
he O
says O
" O
those O
who O
do O
not O
cooperate O
with O
israel B-GPE
, O
will O
have O
to O
be O
crushed O
" O
. O

Surely O
he O
was O
told O
never O
to O
say O
a O
word O
, O
but O
obviously O
given O
his O
age O
may O
well O
have O
slipped O
out O
of O
his O
mouth O
. O

There O
you O
have O
it O
, O
laid O
bare O
for O
all O
to O
see O
. O

Next O
up O
, O
Iran B-GPE
! O

What O
' O
s O
up O
with O
all O
the O
paranoid O
conspiracy O
theory O
threads O
lately O
? O

Isn O
' O
t O
it O
obvious O
? O

It O
' O
s O
a O
conspiracy O
! O

Sorry O
, O
I O
haven O
' O
t O
formulated O
a O
theory O
yet O
, O
but O
give O
me O
some O
time O
. O

The O
key O
elements O
will O
be O
the O
NSA B-ORG
( O
duh O
! O

) O
, O
the O
Triliteral O
Commissariat O
( O
note O
: O
NOT O
the O
trilateral B-ORG
commission I-ORG
) O
, O
the O
alleged O
flatness O
of O
iOS O

, O
and O
a O
donkey O
. O

Oh O
, O
and O
nanothermite O
. O

On O
the O
donkey O
. O

FYI O
, O
all O
donkeys O
are O
allergic O
to O
nanothermite O
charges O
. O

Your O
plan O
wouldn O
' O
t O
work O
. O

Magic O
! O

All O
donkeys O
you O
know O
of O
. O

Hence O
the O
other O
key O
element O
: O
the O
Triliteral O
Commissariat O
. O

Trust O
me O
, O
there O
are O
eminent O
donkey O
physiologists O
on O
it O
, O
as O
well O
as O
logistics O
experts O
, O
and O
highly O
trained O
chefs O
. O

If O
you O
' O
re O
familiar O
with O

and O
its O
relatives O
, O
I O
' O
ll O
just O
say O
they O
' O
re O
nothing O
compared O
to O
donkeys O
. O

Also O
, O
" O
Donkey O
Kong O
" O
: O
not O
a O
translation O
mistake O
. O

Are O
you O
sure O
, O
or O
is O
that O
just O
what O
they O
want O
you O
to O
think O
? O

If O
everyone O
thinks O
donkeys O
are O
allergic O
to O
nonothermite O
charges O
then O
no O
one O
will O
suspect O
a O
thing O
. O
. O
. O

No O
sir O
, O
this O
is O
no O
conspiracy O
but O
rather O
FACT O
. O

I O
think O
you O
have O
hearsay O
confused O
with O
fact O
. O

It O
' O
s O
certainly O
newsworthy O
, O
but O
it O
' O
s O
just O
one O
person O
' O
s O
word O
, O
and O
shouldn O
' O
t O
be O
taken O
as O
any O
more O
than O
that O
without O
any O
kind O
of O
proof O
. O

It O
' O
s O
become O
that O
obvious O
I O
don O
' O
t O
even O
think O
it O
' O
s O
worth O
debating O
. O

We O
should O
have O
faith O
in O
what O
this O
foreign O
minister O
said O
as O
he O
knows O
the O
ins O
and O
outs O
of O
IR O
, O
as O
he O
is O
a O
credible O
source O
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
know O
about O
that O
but O
given O
the O
US B-GPE
attempts O
to O
overthrow O
democratically O
elected O
governments O
it O
is O
hardly O
nuts O
to O
think O
they O
might O
be O
involved O
with O
doing O
the O
same O
to O
dictatorships O
. O

Well O
let O
' O
s O
think O
about O
this O
logically O
: O

- O
2011 O

erupt O
with O
Assad B-PER

- O

despite O
the O

was O
sent O

- O

for O
the O

the O

they O

them O
anywhere O

Why O
do O
we O
care O
about O

in O
the O
Ukraine B-GPE

I O
guess O
because O
they O
think O
now O

the O
perfect O

" O
There O
appear O

have O
been O
no O

Act O
in O
its O
more O
than O
200 O
year O
history O

However O
, O
there O
have O
been O
a O
number O
of O
judicial O
references O
to O
the O
Act O

it O

not O

for O
it O
to O

as O
a O
point O

Although O

it O

at O

a O

it O

The O

is O
a O
deep O
earthy O
brown O
in O
all O

white O
silvery O

from O
America B-GPE
' O
s O
landings O
in O
the O

' O

. O

Is O
this O
because O
of O
different O
photography O
effects O
and O
newer O

or O
does O
the O
color O
of O
the O

than O

are O

Does O
the O

a O

this O

not O
the O
case O

which O

better O

How O
did O

I O

I O
' O
m O
wondering O

look O

I O
that O

the O

- O
China B-GPE
’ O
s O
Cabinet O
has O
adopted O
10 O
measures O
to O
improve O
air O
quality O
in O
the O
latest O

aimed O
at O
responding O
to O
the O

that O

Beijing B-GPE

major O
Chinese B-GPE
cities O
in O
recent O
years O
. O

Many O
of O
the O
measures O
had O
previously O
been O
enacted O
by O
some O
cities O
, O
or O
were O
the O
subject O
of O
national O
experiments O
that O
had O
not O
yet O
received O
the O

the O

The O
measures O
, O
adopted O
Friday O
, O
were O
announced O
Saturday O
in O
state O
- O
controlled O
news O
media O
. O

The O
newest O
and O
least O
- O
expected O
of O
them O
is O
a O
mandate O
that O
heavy O
polluters O
like O
coal O
- O
fired O
power O
plants O
and O
metal O
smelters O
must O
release O
detailed O
environmental O
information O
to O
the O
general O
public O
. O

Ma B-PER
Jun I-PER
, O
the O
director O
of O
the O
Institute B-ORG
of I-ORG
Public I-ORG
and I-ORG
Environmental I-ORG
Affairs I-ORG
, O
one O
of O
the O
best O
- O
known O
independent O
environmental O
activist O
groups O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
, O
said O
that O
5 O
, O
000 O
of O
the O
country O
’ O
s O
biggest O
factories O
account O
for O
three O
- O
fifths O
of O
its O
industrial O
pollution O
, O
but O
that O
the O
public O
knows O
few O
details O
about O
their O
emissions O
. O

“ O
In O
China B-GPE
, O
the O
factories O
can O
just O
discharge O
without O
letting O
people O
know O
, O
” O
he O
said O
. O

“ O
If O
we O
can O
bring O
them O
under O
public O
supervision O
, O
it O
would O
make O
a O
big O
difference O
. O
” O

Still O
, O
he O
cautioned O
that O
while O
national O
leaders O
may O
want O
a O
cleaner O
environment O
, O
enforcing O
tough O
pollution O
regulations O
at O
the O
local O
level O
could O
prove O
difficult O
. O

The O
Cabinet O
also O
ordered O
that O
heavy O
polluters O
reduce O
their O
emissions O
for O
each O
unit O
of O
economic O
output O
by O
30 O
percent O
by O
the O
end O
of O
2017 O
. O

But O
if O
the O
economy O
grows O
7 O
percent O
or O
more O
a O
year O
, O
as O
forecast O
, O
the O
decrease O
in O
total O
pollution O
would O
be O
modest O
. O

China B-GPE
has O
seen O
a O
rapid O
growth O
over O
the O
past O
two O
years O
in O
the O
number O
of O
environmental O
protests O
. O

Crowds O
numbering O
in O
the O
thousands O
have O
taken O
to O
the O
streets O
in O
coastal O
cities O
including O
Dalian B-GPE
, O
Tianjin B-GPE
and O
Xiamen B-GPE
to O
prevent O
the O
construction O
or O
continued O
operation O
of O
large O
chemical O
plants O
. O

Coal O
- O
fired O
power O
plants O
have O
been O
blocked O
in O
southern O
China B-GPE
’ O
s O
Guangdong B-GPE
and O
Hainan B-GPE
provinces O
. O

And O
rock O
- O
throwing O
mobs O
forced O
the O
cancellation O
of O
a O
copper O
smelter O
a O
year O
ago O
in O
Shifang B-GPE
, O
a O
town O
near O
Chengdu B-GPE
in O
Sichuan B-GPE
province O
, O
in O
western O
China B-GPE
. O

The O
new O
10 O
- O
part O
program O
calls O
for O
greater O
cooperation O
among O
cities O
and O
provinces O
. O

For O
example O
, O
Beijing B-GPE
is O
trying O
to O
reduce O
its O
consumption O
of O
heavily O
- O
polluting O
coal O
, O
but O
the O
nearby O
city O
of O
Tianjin B-GPE
and O
adjacent O
Hebei B-GPE
province O
are O
expanding O
their O
already O
huge O
coal O
- O
dependent O
industries O
in O
sectors O
like O
petrochemicals O
and O
steel O
. O

The O
Cabinet O
’ O
s O
action O
includes O
some O
measures O
already O
taken O
by O
very O
large O
municipal O
governments O
like O
Beijing B-GPE
and O
Shanghai B-GPE
. O

Both O
cities O
already O
require O
much O
cleaner O
gasoline O
and O
diesel O
, O
so O
that O
cars O
and O
trucks O
will O
emit O
less O
tailpipe O
pollution O
, O
and O
those O
policies O
are O
now O
supposed O
to O
be O
applied O
nationwide O
. O

The O
State B-ORG
Council I-ORG
also O
called O
for O
more O
cities O
to O
prepare O
emergency O
response O
plans O
for O
heavy O
pollution O
, O
including O
traffic O
restrictions O
and O
limits O
on O
local O
industries O
. O

It O
also O
ordered O
heavier O
fines O
for O
polluters O
and O
stricter O
requirements O
for O
environmental O
impact O
statements O
. O

Concerns O
about O
street O
protests O
over O
environmental O
disputes O
had O
already O
led O
the O
Cabinet O
to O
announce O
last O
November O
that O
it O
would O
require O
a O
“ O
social O
risk O
assessment O
” O
before O
allowing O
major O
industrial O
projects O
to O
proceed O
. O

Corporate O
leaders O
say O
that O
the O
Chinese B-GPE
public O
has O
rapidly O
become O
more O
prone O
to O
question O
the O
wisdom O
of O
big O
investment O
projects O
, O
particularly O
in O
the O
chemical O
industry O
. O

“ O
This O
is O
quite O
fast O
, O
how O
this O
reaction O
has O
stepped O
up O
, O
particularly O
in O
China B-GPE

is O
possible O

of O

can O

Another O
Western B-LOC
intervention O
into O
a O
Middle B-LOC
Eastern I-LOC
war O
looms O
, O
I O
think O
. O
. O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
your O
predictions O
could O
all O
too O
likely O
become O
reality O
, O
which O
is O
both O
frightening O
and O
saddening O
. O

I O
hope O
you O
' O
re O
wrong O
, O
but O
. O
. O
. O
. O

There O
wont O
be O
any O
western B-LOC
intervention O
in O
Syria B-GPE
due O
to O
the O
alleged O
use O
of O
chemical O
weapons O
. O

This O
claim O
has O
been O
raised O
by O
Israel B-GPE
a O
little O
while O
ago O
. O

However O
there O
was O
a O
lack O
of O
evidence O
- O
most O
chemical O
weapons O
kill O
within O
a O
short O
space O
of O
time O
- O
you O
usually O
would O
not O
have O
managed O
to O
get O
pics O
of O
someone O
suffering O
in O
hospital O
and O
taken O
pics O
as O
evidence O
on O
the O
field O
would O
be O
more O
obvious O
. O

Possibly O
Israel B-GPE
is O
more O
concerned O
with O
defending O
another O
border O
. O

Recently O
Israel B-GPE
was O
saying O
that O
if O
they O
have O
intelligence O
that O
Assad B-PER
' O
s O
chemical O
weapons O
will O
fall O
into O
the O
wrong O
hands O
( O
eg O
: O
AQ B-ORG
& O
amp O
; O
Hez B-ORG
) O
, O
they O
will O
take O
action O
. O

So O
does O
this O
mean O
then O
that O
it O
Assad B-PER
' O
s O
hands O
are O
not O
considered O
" O
wrong O
hands O
" O
. O

This O
all O
seems O
like O
a O
convenient O
excuse O
for O
the O
West B-LOC
, O
Turkey B-GPE
and O
Gulfies O
to O
enter O
the O
fray O
and O
install O
a O
Sunni O
regime O
. O

Could O
be O
a O
flase O
flag O
; O
i O
. O
e O
. O

Mossad B-ORG
and O
or O
Rebels O
introduce O
a O
substance O
to O
a O
limited O
area O
that O
causes O
people O
to O
exhibit O
signs O
claimed O
to O
be O
from O
chemical O
weapons O
. O

Could O
also O
be O
true O
. O

Assad B-PER
maybee O
on O
the O
ropes O
so O
has O
to O
resort O
to O
more O
deadly O
weapons O
. O

It O
is O
surreal O
how O
the O
Western B-LOC
powers O
warn O
him O
they O
will O
intervene O
if O
he O
uses O
chemical O
weapons O
but O
the O
reason O
he O
may O
use O
them O
is O
because O
Western B-LOC
powers O
are O
supporting O
the O
rebels O
. O

Israel B-GPE
won O
' O
t O
do O
anything O
. O

" O
The O
West B-LOC
" O
won O
' O
t O
do O
anything O
. O

Both O
will O
sit O
back O
and O
watch O
and O
wait O
for O
Syria B-GPE
to O
burn O
itself O
out O
. O

Particularly O
as O
it O
gives O
very O
useful O
information O
as O
to O
who O
is O
coming O
in O
from O
abroad O
to O
" O
freedom O
" O
fight O
. O

That O
wouldn O
' O
t O
be O
such O
a O
bad O
scenario O
. O

It O
' O
s O
the O
one O
they O
are O
now O
tired O
of O
playing O
out O
. O

I O
watched O
McCain B-PER
and O
a O
few O
senators O
raving O
on O
tv O
last O
night O
. O

Pretty O
sure O
the O
US B-GPE
will O
interven O
soon O

Israel B-GPE
is O
feeling O
the O
pressure O
- O
they O
are O
buggered O
if O
Assad B-PER
goes O
down O
as O
the O
rebels O
may O
turn O
the O
weapons O
onto O
them O
, O
which O
means O
them O
defending O
another O
border O
. O

They O
are O
also O
concerned O
with O
Lebanon B-GPE
and O
border O
skirmishes O
. O

Their O
best O
bet O
is O
that O
Assad B-PER
quashes O
the O
rebels O
- O
however O
he O
is O
on O
a O
losing O
wicket O
, O
or O
to O
" O
persuade O
" O
the O
US B-GPE
to O
intervene O
. O

The O
pressure O
is O
on O
Assad B-PER
to O
end O
this O
- O
the O
West B-LOC
wont O
get O
involved O
as O
there O
is O
no O
profit O

Bush B-PER
wants O
to O
enlarge O
the O
size O
of O

Says O
" O
all O
options O
are O
on O
the O
table O
" O
to O
do O
this O
. O

I O
personally O
think O
its O
only O
a O
matter O
of O
time O
until O
it O
does O
happen O
. O

How O
does O
Bush B-PER
expect O
to O
continue O
his O
wars O
in O
the O
Middle B-LOC
East I-LOC
? O

We O
can O
' O
t O
keep O
these O
18 O

of O
our O

going O
forever O
. O

All O

are O
already O
on O
active O
duty O
. O
. O
. O
where O
else O
do O
we O
pull O
from O
? O

A O
lot O
of O
you O
might O
say O
this O
would O
be O
political O
suicide O
to O
do O
this O
, O
not O
only O
for O
Bush B-PER
but O
for O
the O
Republican B-ORG
party I-ORG
but O
what O
other O
option O
does O
he O
have O
to O
attempt O
to O
do O
something O
in O
the O
Middle B-LOC
East I-LOC
. O

Especially O
with O
our O
build O
up O
of O
Navy B-ORG
forces O
to O
show O
a O
military O
strength O
in O
the O
Persian B-LOC
Gulf I-LOC
against O
Iran B-GPE
. O

If O
a O
draft O
doesn O
' O
t O
happen O
now O
all O
it O
will O
take O
is O
one O
more O
domestic O
terrorist O
attack O
, O
or O
the O
involvement O
of O
Iran B-GPE
in O
some O
type O
of O
war O
. O

Funny O
but O
terrifying O
video O
: O

Mhh O
, O
I O
don O
' O
t O
think O
a O
draft O
is O
in O
the O
works O
. O

It O
' O
s O
not O
exactly O
the O
most O
popular O
option O
the O
president O
could O
take O
, O
and O
I O
doubt O
he O
would O
want O
to O
further O
damage O
his O
reputation O
when O
he O
' O
s O
already O
so O
disliked O
. O

He O
' O
s O
got O
a O
legacy O
to O
build O
, O
remember O
? O

I O
doubt O
he O
wants O
to O
be O
remembered O
as O
the O
president O
who O
supported O
an O
unpopular O
war O
with O
an O
even O
more O
unpopular O
draft O
late O
in O
his O
second O
term O
, O
where O
any O
draft O
instituted O
would O
likely O
be O
revoked O
by O
an O
incoming O
president O
anyway O
. O

i O
really O
hope O
not O
. O
. O
. O
it O
wouldn O
' O
t O
suprise O
me O
, O
does O
anything O
suprise O
anyone O
anymore O
? O

Granted O
, O
this O
would O
be O
a O
political O
decision O
, O
but O
I O
' O
m O
in O
the O
Army B-ORG
and O
there O
are O
probably O
a O
total O
of O
three O
people O
in O
the O
entire O
US B-GPE
military O
who O
are O
in O
favor O
of O
a O
draft O
. O

So O
, O
absent O
a O
world O
war O
, O
I O
' O
d O
say O
you O
' O
re O
pretty O
safe O
. O

What O
a O
way O
to O
ruin O
the O
world O
. O
. O

It O
' O
s O
tough O
enough O
to O
get O
a O
job O
. O
. O
We O
' O
re O
losing O
so O
much O
money O
over O
the O
world O
. O
. O
You O
know O
what O
. O
. O
yeah O
let O
' O
s O
waste O
more O
money O
on O
this O
. O
. O
More O
experiments O
. O
. O

So O
DUMB O
! O
! O
! O
! O

No O
, O
don O
' O
t O
worry O
, O
it O
won O
' O
t O
happen O
. O

No O
one O
would O
support O
it O
. O

If O
there O
was O
a O
draft O
, O
I O
would O
immediately O
drop O
what O
I O
was O
doing O
and O
protest O
at O
the O
capitol B-FAC
. O

I O
think O
there O
would O
be O
a O
huge O
amount O
of O
outrage O
for O
drafting O
people O
to O
an O
abysmal O
war O
that O
was O
started O
on O
lies O
. O

We O
would O
leave O
Iraq B-GPE
a O
smoldering O
crater O
before O
we O
would O
institute O
a O
draft O
. O

Well O
most O
economists O
say O
starting O
a O
war O
is O
a O
good O
way O
to O
increase O
GDP O
. O
. O
. O

And O
most O
would O
be O
right O
just O
about O
every O
single O
time O
. O

Is O
this O
true O
apart O
from O
WW1 O
and O
WW2 O
? O

Limited O
, O
unsuccessful O
engagements O
probably O
don O

During O
the O
2004 O
election O
campaign O
John B-PER
Kerry I-PER
put O
forward O
the O
idea O
of O
the O
need O
to O
expand O
the O
military O
along O
with O
concentrating O
on O
building O
up O
certain O
critical O
functions O
. O

Now O
, O
two O
and O
a O
half O
years O
later O
of O
saying O
everything O
was O
fine O
with O
the O
US B-GPE
military O
and O
Iraq B-GPE
on O
the O
verge O
of O
total O
collapse O
, O
Bush B-PER
uses O
this O
idea O
for O
cover O
to O
accomplish O
something O
it O
was O
never O
meant O
to O
do O
- O
keep O
us O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

If O
the O
greater O
numbers O
were O
even O
the O
answer O
to O
Iraq B-GPE
, O
they O
won O
' O
t O
be O
on O
line O
until O
2008 O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
we O
shall O
continue O
the O
same O
insanity O
with O
a O
policy O
that O
every O
knowledgeable O
military O
source O
says O
is O
going O

they O
felt O
that O

die O
trying O
to O

All O
this O
could O
have O
been O
avoided O

But O
Bush B-PER
chose O
not O
to O
stop O
a O
terrorist O
leader O
when O
he O
had O
the O
chance O
, O
because O
he O
had O

Those O

: O
does O
Bush B-PER
really O
do O
justice O
to O

He O
' O

certainly O
not O

Please O

do O
something O

the O

Explain O

You O
know O
I O
' O
ve O
posted O
that O

5 O

10 O
threads O
on O
this O
board O
when O
Bush B-PER
' O
s O
terrorism O
record O
comes O
up O
. O

There O
is O
also O
a O
thread O
on O
it O
here O
: O

No O
one O
has O
even O
tried O
to O
defend O
Bush B-PER
and O
the O
administration O
' O
s O
actions O
on O
this O
. O

Personally O
this O
story O
scares O
the O
hell O
out O
of O
me O
. O

It O
makes O
it O
even O
worse O
when O
you O
see O
the O
quote O
where O
he O
says O
he O
' O
s O
not O
that O
concerned O
about O
bin B-PER
- I-PER
Laden I-PER
. O

They O
keep O
saying O
that O
Kerry B-PER
has O
no O
grasp O
of O
the O
war O
on O
terror O
, O
but O
Bush B-PER
' O
s O
actions O
manage O
to O
prove O
he O
has O
no O
grasp O
either O
. O

In O
his O
desire O
to O
overthrow O
the O
states O
that O
" O
support O
" O
terrorism O
he O
is O
completely O
ignoring O
the O
terrorists O
themselves O
. O

How O
many O
lives O
could O
have O
been O
saved O
had O
we O
taken O
out O
Zarqawi B-PER
before O
invasion O
? O

It O
might O
have O
weakened O
our O
case O
for O
war O
and O
led O
to O
us O
not O
invading O
. O

There O
' O
s O
1000 O
troops O
right O
there O
, O
not O
to O
mention O
the O
Iraqi B-GPE
casualties O
and O
the O
civilians O
that O
Zarqawi B-PER
has O
managed O
to O
capture O
and O
kill O
. O

How O
can O
you O
conduct O
the O
war O
on O
terror O
when O
you O
don O
' O
t O
pay O
any O
attention O
to O
the O
terrorists O
? O

There O
' O
s O
also O
another O
story O
on O
it O
here O
: O

Without O
having O
to O
go O
into O
major O
details O
, O
the O
biggest O
sign O
that O
the O
Republican B-ORG
Party I-ORG
supports O
him O
is O
that O
he O
is O
on O
the O
Republican B-ORG
canidate O
for O
president O
. O

Um O
. O

Hmmm O
. O

Let O
' O
s O
see O
here O
. O

I O
wonder O
if O
the O
party O
, O
say O
, O
decided O
not O
to O
go O
with O
the O
incumbent O
president O
as O
their O
candidate O
. O

Would O
that O
be O
political O
suicide O
? O

Yes O
, O
I O
think O
so O
. O

Their O
hands O
are O
tied O
. O

They O
had O
to O
go O
with O
Bush B-PER
. O

Just O
like O
the O
Dems B-ORG
had O
to O
go O
with O
Clinton B-PER
in O
' O
96 O
. O

I O
' O
m O
not O
saying O
either O
was O
a O
good O
or O
bad O
choice O
- O
not O
in O
this O
post O
- O
but O
to O
argue O
that O
a O
party O
' O
supports O
' O
the O
incumbent O
president O
because O
they O
renominated O
him O
is O
too O
simplistic O
. O

They O
supported O
him O
in O
2000 O
. O

They O
more O
or O
less O
had O
to O
renominate O
him O
in O
2004 O

they O

all O
of O
their O
upcoming O

What O
would O
you O
do O
as O
a O
company O
concerning O
a O

ruling O
which O
hurts O
your O
public O

? O

Sit O

take O
it O

Their O
recent O

really O
have O
less O
to O
do O
with O
moral O
standing O
than O
logical O

. O

I O
find O
the O
whole O
thing O
a O
bit O
strange O
. O

As O
I O
followed O
this O
in O
the O
news O
, O
my O
impression O
was O
that O
Apple B-ORG
would O
win O
this O
case O
. O

My O
take O
was O
that O
they O
had O
a O
different O
model O
than O
Amazon B-ORG
; O
essentially O
using O
the O
same O
model O
they O
used O
for O
music O
. O

A O
proven O
practice O
that O
made O
sense O
. O

I O
was O
surprised O
when O
the O
court O
ruled O
against O
them O
. O

I O
was O
even O
more O
surprised O
by O
the O
whole O
auditor O
issue O
. O

I O
agree O
that O
it O
makes O
a O
lot O
of O
sense O
for O
Apple B-ORG
to O
continue O
fighting O
this O
. O

If O
they O
lose O
, O
what O
model O
will O
Apple B-ORG
have O
to O
resort O
to O
? O

Back O
to O
Amazon B-ORG
price O
setting O
model O
? O

I O
really O
hope O
not O
. O

I O
' O
m O
not O
surprised O
they O
filed O
the O
appeal O
. O

No O
one O
should O
be O
. O

It O
' O
s O
smart O
business O
. O

However O
I O
have O
little O
faith O
that O
they O
' O
ll O
overturn O
the O
verdict O
or O
that O
they O
didn O
' O
t O
engage O
in O
some O
dodgy O
practices O
based O
on O
all O
the O
evidence O
presented O
. O

As O
a O
publisher O
myself O
, O
I O
am O
rooting O
for O
Apple B-ORG
' O

appeal O
to O
be O
fully O

It O
' O

Iran B-GPE

really O
trying O

Today O
the O

but O
kinda O
stiff O

No O

Khamenei B-PER
kept O
the O

at O

he O
has O
to O

I O
wonder O
how O

go O
on O

. O
. O
. O

Here O
' O

the O
bottom O
line O
from O
the O
piece O
: O

Unlike O
in O
2005 O
, O
viewers O
were O
not O
told O
when O
the O
ceremony O
would O
start O
, O
and O
it O
was O
not O
broadcast O
live O
, O
perhaps O
to O
avoid O
highlighting O
the O
number O
of O
eyebrow O
- O
raising O
no O
- O
shows O
, O
which O
included O
opposition O
leader O
Mousavi B-PER
, O
a O
former O
prime O
minister O
; O
two O
former O
presidents O
; O
the O
head O
of O

. O

Another O
piece O
, O
in O
the O
Washington B-GPE
Post O
, O
noted O
that O
the O
grandson O
of O
Ayatollah O
Khomeini B-PER
, O
the O
leader O
of O
the O
1979 O
Iranian B-GPE
revolution O
, O
was O
conveniently O
off O
visiting O
somewhere O
in O
Pakistan B-GPE
upon O
this O
occasion O
, O
and O
that O
other O
Khomeini O
relatives O
also O
took O
a O
pass O
on O
the O
confirmation O

I O
find O
that O
quite O
interesting O

Ukraine B-GPE

I O
guess O
that O
there O
will O
shortly O
be O
other O
riots O
, O
looting O
and O
violence O
for O
immediate O
membership O
of O
the O
EU B-GPE

Amazing O
that O
the O
EU B-GPE
condones O
mob O
violence O
in O
the O
Ukraine B-GPE
but O
not O
in O
their O
own O
countries O
. O

M B-PER

Iv O
' O
e O
seen O
no O
stories O
of O
looting O
what O
so O
ever O
. O

Seriously O
? O

The O
conflict O
is O
about O
100s O
of O
years O
of O
history O
where O
Russians O
have O
controlled O
, O
dominated O
and O
starved O
the O
Ukrainian B-GPE
population O
. O

Most O
ethnic O
Ukranians O
want O
to O
break O
away O
from O
Russia B-GPE
, O
quite O
understandably O
given O
the O
way O
that O
they O
have O
always O
been O
treated O
by O
them O

However O
, O
there O
are O
also O
lots O
of O
ethnic O
Russians O
in O
the O
Ukraine B-GPE
, O
including O
the O
current O
president O
, O
who O
are O
controlled O
and O
bribed O
by O
Putin B-PER
. O

Russia B-GPE
doesnt O
want O
to O
lose O
the O
Ukraine B-GPE
to O
the O
EU B-GPE
as O
it O
is O
critical O
for O
their O
plans O
to O
return O
as O
a O
global O
superpower O
, O
but O
many O
Ukranians O
equate O
the O
EU B-GPE
to O
freedom O

This O
conflict O
has O
the O
potential O
to O
end O
in O
a O
serious O
and O
horrible O
civil O
war O

Your O
' O
e O
right O
. O

The O
EU B-GPE
doesn O
' O
t O
like O
dissent O
- O
it O
likes O
control O
. O

Bit O
of O
a O
paradox O
. O

Does O
the O
EU B-GPE
condone O
mob O
violence O
in O
The O
Ukraine B-GPE
? O

The O
President O
has O
shut O
down O
newspapers O
and O
tv O
stations O
, O
made O
previously O
legal O
protesting O
illegal O
and O
sent O
the O
Paramilitary O
police O
in O
to O
deal O
with O
protestors O
and O
it O
' O
s O
the O
protestors O
that O
are O
to O
blame O
. O
. O
. O

Interesting O
. O

Malcolm B-PER
X I-PER
was O
right O
when O
he O
wrote O
those O
prophetic O
words O
. O
. O
. O
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
know O
who O
is O
to O
blame O
but O
since O
when O
does O
a O
mob O
in O
a O
City O
square O
become O
a O
majority O
. O

We O
have O
seen O
it O
happen O
in O
many O
places O
over O
the O
past O
few O
years O
and O
it O
always O
ends O
in O
violence O
on O
both O
sides O
. O

There O
seems O
to O
be O
an O
automatic O
assumption O
in O
the O
media O
that O
Protesters O
are O
always O
right O
. O

Best O
way O
forward O
would O
be O
to O
have O
an O
election O
. O

Well O
if O
you O
call O
them O
a O
mob O
then O
you O
have O
already O
made O
your O
mind O
up O

They O
are O
people O
fighting O
for O
their O
democratic O
rights O
. O

And O
actually O
the O
demonstrations O
were O
entirely O
peaceful O
until O
the O
police O
started O
setting O
their O
tents O
on O
fire O
while O
they O
were O
still O
in O
them O
! O

Just O
as O
in O
Spain B-GPE
, O
and O
in O
a O
smaller O
part O
, O
in O
London B-GPE
. O

The O
police O
are O
the O
mobs O
who O
go O
around O
violenting O
distributing O
" O
justice O
" O
. O

The O
worst O
thing O
of O
all O
is O
that O
they O
are O
instructed O
to O
do O
so O
by O
the O
politicians O
. O

The O
concept O
of O
democracy O
is O
been O
lost O
across O
Europe B-LOC
. O

Every O
day O
, O
we O
have O
fewer O
and O
fewer O
rights O
. O

It O
is O
the O
price O
to O
pay O
to O
ensure O
the O
status O
quo O
i O
. O
e O
. O

the O
rich O
must O
remain O
rich O
at O
any O
human O
cost O

It O
' O
s O
a O
mob O
when O
they O
start O
taking O
over O
and O
occupying O
government O
buildings O
. O

There O
are O
also O
many O
far O
right O
groups O
involved O
. O

Don O
' O
t O
forget O
this O
country O
has O
a O
history O
of O
internal O
fighting O
. O

Perhaps O
both O
sides O
are O
wrong O
. O

Ukrainian B-GPE

Good O

As O

has O
proved O

many O

( O
just O

you O

manufacture O
countries O
and O
expect O
the O
different O
regions O

political O

to O
co O
exist O
without O

The O
Crimea B-GPE

The O
poor O

" O
The O

According O
to O
official O
documents O
effective O
from O
May O

, O
environmental O
protection O

Without O

Cyprus B-GPE
would O
soon O
slip O
into O
an O
uncontrolled O

this O

The O

from O

that O
during O

hour O
hard O
bargaining O
the O
Cypriot B-GPE

had O
threatened O
three O
times O
to O
leave O

and O
asked O
for O
a O
break O
to O
consult O
with O

associates O
. O

In O
the O
end O
he O
was O
faced O
with O
the O
dilemma O
of O
either O
a O
default O
along O
with O
exiting O
the O

or O
accepting O
the O

dictated O
by O

Cyprus B-GPE
finance O
minister O
said O
it O
had O
been O
a O
difficult O
decision O
to O
take O
, O
which O
however O
averts O
a O
bankruptcy O
and O
offers O
the O
possibility O
of O
a O
new O

However O
, O
he O
seemed O
to O
be O
himself O
shocked O
by O
the O
Eurogroup B-ORG
decision O
, O
which O
triggered O
widespread O
reaction O
in O
Cyprus B-GPE

" O
I O

it O
' O

not O

I O
think O
it O
' O

silly O
that O

especially O
since O

' O
t O
MAKING O

, O
I O
hope O

don O

have O

the O
riaa B-ORG
loves O

as O
well O
as O
most O
of O

plus O
they O
should O
have O
sued O

back O
in O
the O
early O
sytem O
days O
in O
they O
encorparated O
sound O

iJon O

Maybe O
they O
should O
take O
this O
opportunity O
to O
do O

because O
if O
I O
recall O
correctly O

, O
the O
technology O
giant O
’ O
s O
second O
- O
biggest O
after O
the O
acquisition O
of O
Skype B-ORG
, O
was O
a O
lengthy O
process O
that O
was O
anything O
but O
straightforward O
, O
people O
briefed O
on O
the O
matter O
said O
Tuesday O
. O

Steve B-PER
Ballmer I-PER
, O
Microsoft B-ORG
’ O
s O
chief O
executive O
, O
first O
approached O
Nokia B-ORG
about O
a O
deal O
during O
the O
Mobile O
World O
Congress O
industry O
conference O
in O
Barcelona B-GPE
this O
year O
. O

He O
emphasized O
to O
Stephen B-PER
Elop I-PER
, O
his O
counterpart O
at O
Nokia B-ORG
since O
2010 O
, O
that O
the O
software O
company O
needed O
to O
continue O
its O
hardware O
evolution O
by O
developing O
smaller O
handsets O
. O

Integrating O
hardware O
and O
software O
, O
in O
the O
mold O
of O
Apple B-ORG
, O
was O
an O
important O
priority O
. O

But O
Microsoft B-ORG
also O
wanted O
to O
ensure O
that O
Elop B-PER
, O
a O
former O
executive O
, O
would O
come O
along O
as O
part O
of O
the O
deal O
. O

Nokia B-ORG
at O
that O
point O
felt O
that O
Elop B-PER
was O
compromised O
and O
arranged O
for O
Riisto B-PER
Siilasmaa I-PER
, O
the O
Finnish B-GPE
company O
’ O
s O
chairman O
, O
to O
take O
over O
negotiations O
. O

Still O
, O
the O
prospect O
of O
Nokia B-ORG
shedding O
its O
core O
business O
weighed O
heavily O
on O
the O
company O
. O

Nokia B-ORG
’ O
s O
directors O
met O
around O
50 O
times O
in O
person O
to O
discuss O
virtually O
every O
angle O
of O
the O
deal O
, O
from O
valuation O
to O
the O
potential O
impact O
on O
the O
handset O
unit O
’ O
s O
32 O
, O
000 O
workers O
. O

Much O
of O
the O
discussions O
were O
held O
directly O
between O
Ballmer B-PER
and O
Siilasmaa B-PER
, O
who O
met O
discreetly O
in O
Helsinki B-GPE
, O
London B-GPE
, O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
and O
Seattle B-GPE
, O
among O
other O
cities O
. O

The O
talks O
moved O
deliberately O
, O
with O
both O
sides O
taking O
time O
to O
figure O
out O
how O
the O
new O
structure O
would O
work O
and O
figure O
out O
how O
to O
unravel O
the O
commercial O
agreements O
. O

This O
summer O
, O
talks O
between O
the O
two O
sides O
cooled O
, O
as O
the O
complexities O
of O
the O
transaction O
took O
a O
toll O
. O

They O
resumed O
in O
July O
, O
with O
a O
broad O
agreement O
on O
the O
principles O
of O
the O
transaction O
reached O
by O
the O
end O
of O
that O
month O

rather O
than O

that O
may O
not O
actually O
come O

if O

that O
is O
an O
unintended O
consequence O
I O
am O

According O
to O

news I-ORG
, O
there O
is O

in O

You O
waken O
up O
and O
your O
money O
- O
or O
some O
of O
it O
- O
has O
gone O
. O

The O
money O
hasnt O
" O
gone O
" O
- O
it O
has O
been O
transferred O
into O
the O
form O
of O
shares O
of O
the O
bank O
. O

What O
would O
worry O
me O
more O
is O
that O
this O
is O
the O
first O
time O
the O
governements O
have O
done O
this O
and O
would O
this O
be O
a O
new O
standard O
. O

I O
think O
Monday O
/ O
Tuesday O
you O
may O
see O
bank O
runs O
especially O
in O
Greece B-GPE
and O
Spain B-GPE
. O

If O
that O
does O
happen O
then O
the O
Euro O
will O
go O
down O
to O
a O
new O
lower O
and O
the O
markets O
will O
lose O
their O
recent O
gains O
. O

It O
' O
s O
gone O
then O
, O
no O
? O

You O
have O
just O
described O
a O
debt O
- O
equity O
swap O
- O
and O
debt O
is O
the O
driver O
of O
money O
under O
a O
fiat O
monetary O
system O
. O

The O
value O
may O
not O
have O
gone O
though O
- O
- O
if O
you O
believe O
the O
banks O
will O
be O
there O
tomorrow O
once O
the O
run O
is O
over O
. O

Was O
talking O
to O
a O
colleague O
who O
is O
from O
Cyprus B-GPE
and O
his O
wife O
is O
still O
living O
there O
. O

Apparently O
there O
were O
riots O
last O
night O
in O
some O
areas O
and O
all O
the O
ATM O
' O
s O
have O
been O
blocked O
so O
nobody O
can O
take O
money O
out O
! O

Shame O
for O
the O
folks O
living O
there O
, O
still O
, O
I O
have O
absolute O
faith O
in O
an O
Cypriot B-GPE
government O
to O
manage O
the O
economy O
out O
of O
this O
. O

But O
the O
Cypriot B-GPE
Government O
is O
just O
like O
Greece B-GPE
, O
they O
' O
re O
in O
there O
for O
themselves O
. O

A O
previous O
company O
I O
worked O
for O
would O
regularly O
pay O
massive O
bribes O
to O
Greece B-GPE
/ O
Cyprus B-GPE
to O
win O
business O
. O

It O
lined O
the O
pockets O
of O
the O
ministers O
/ O
CEOs O
etc O
. O

but O
it O
' O
s O
basically O
broike O
the O
countries O
. O

To O
give O
you O
an O
example O
, O
we O
would O
usually O
charge O
around O
10cents O
for O
a O
transaction O
, O
with O
Cyprus B-GPE
and O
Greece B-GPE
we O
charged O
over O
$ O
20 O
. O

And O
purely O
to O
pay O
the O
bribes O
. O

Ridiculous O
. O

I O
do O
feel O
sorry O
for O
the O
populace O
, O
but O
they O
did O
vote O
the O
government O
in O
. O

Their O
options O
are O
limited O
though O
, O
no O
? O

Same O
shit O
different O
toilet O
. O

It O
' O
s O
inherent O
in O
the O
Greeks O
to O
be O
* O
* O
* O
* O
ing O
lazy O
and O
avoid O
all O
costs O
to O
government O
etc O
. O

Dad O
lives O
in O
Crete B-GPE
and O
the O
tricks O
they O
pull O
to O
avoid O
council O
taxes O
etc O
etc O
are O
just O
mad O
. O

Pretend O
to O
build O
an O
extra O
floor O
, O
just O
leave O
some O
reinforced O
columsn O
sticking O
out O
the O
top O
and O
tell O
the O
council O
you O
' O
ve O
not O
finished O
building O
yet O
so O
don O
' O
t O
have O
to O
pay O
council O
tax O
. O

I O
wonder O
if O
the O
Russian B-GPE
Government O
will O
help O
all O
the O
Russians O
who O
have O
money O
in O
Cyprus B-GPE
? O

Limassol B-GPE
is O
known O
locally O
as O
“ O
Lima B-GPE
- I-GPE
grad I-GPE
” O
. O

It O
is O
the O
most O
outrageous O
and O
astonishing O
thing O
I O
' O
ve O
heard O
in O
EUR B-LOC
- O
history O
( O
and O
that O
is O
a O
tough O
title O
to O
win O
) O
. O

The O
banks O
are O
insolvent O
so O
the O
shares O
are O
worthless O
( O
try O
to O
work O
out O
the O
' O
book O
value O
' O
for O
some O
of O
those O
banks O
. O
. O
. O
. O
) O
- O
and O
you O
cannot O
sell O
the O
shares O
anyway O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O

It O
is O
another O
nail O
in O
the O
EURO O
- O
coffin O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O
and O
I O
worry O
about O
this O
sort O
of O
thing O
on O
a O
wider O
socio O
- O
economic O
scale O
: O
at O
some O
point O
( O
maybe O
not O
far O
off O
) O
the O
people O
of O
Europe B-LOC
( O
particularly O
in O
the O
southern O
nations O
) O
will O
rise O
up O
in O
civil O
violence O
against O
austerity O
, O
etc O
, O
while O
those O
in O
the O
north O
will O
rise O
up O
against O
their O
taxes O
being O
raised O
again O
and O
again O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
profligacy O
of O
southern O
governments O
. O

Then O
, O
gangs O
of O
racist O
vigilantes O
will O
start O
patrolling O
the O
streets O
, O
torching O
houses O
and O
intimidating O
residents O
in O
largely O
immigrant O
neighbourhoods O
, O
because O
far O
right O
parties O
and O
pressure O
groups O
will O
have O
convinced O
them O
that O
immigrants O
are O
to O
blame O
for O
unemployment O
, O
high O
taxes O
, O
high O
unemployment O
, O
etc O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O

One O
day O

Nelson B-PER
Mandela I-PER
has O
died O

I O
can O
' O
t O
think O
what O
to O
say O
. O

I O
think O
it O
was O
hardly O
unexpected O
, O
and O
lord O
knows O
he O
' O
s O
done O
enough O
in O
this O
lifetime O

RIP O
Mr O

Mandela B-PER
. O

Yes O
, O
RIP O
, O
what O
an O
incredible O
life O
. O

His O
timing O
however O
, O
sucks O
. O

I O
already O
had O
him O
penciled O
in O
my O
2014 O
Death O
Pool O
. O

Whichever O
, O
he O
deserves O
the O
peace O
he O
' O
ll O
have O
now O
. O

I O
' O
d O
say O
when O
you O
' O
re O
95 O
, O
it O
' O
s O
never O
really O
unexpected O
. O

Still O
, O
I O
' O
m O
sorry O
to O
hear O
of O
his O
death O
. O

Not O
unexpected O
, O
but O
still O
sad O
. O
. O
. O
. O

The O
end O
of O
an O
incredible O
journey O
by O
a O
man O
who O
had O
the O
courage O
of O
his O
convictions O
. O

I O
wonder O
if O
they O
' O
ll O
tack O
a O
trailer O
obit O
onto O
the O
new O
film O
. O

Sorry O
to O
hear O
this O
. O

He O
helped O
make O
history O
in O
South B-GPE
Africa I-GPE

Now O
Mandela B-PER
can O
rest O
with O
MLK B-PER

Gandhi B-PER

and O

Imagine O
the O
stories O
they O
can O
share O
with O
each O
other O
. O

R O

I O
. O
P O

Got O
a O
lotta O

done O
. O

Agreed O
, O
but O
you O
just O
know O
the O
media O
, O
social O
and O
otherwise O
, O
is O
going O
to O
lose O
its O
collective O
mind O
over O
this O
. O

I O
hope O
the O
coverage O
is O
as O
dignified O
as O
he O
was O
. O

Mandela B-PER
leaves O
a O
tremendous O
legacy O
behind O
. O

In O
200 O
years O
, O
his O
name O
will O
still O
be O
invoked O
in O
South B-GPE
Africa I-GPE
, O
as O
George B-PER
Washington I-PER
' O
s O
is O
in O
the O
U B-GPE
. I-GPE
S I-GPE
. O

Yep O
. O

I O
know O
. O
. O
. O
it O
' O
s O
going O
to O
be O
one O
long O
outpouring O
of O
. O
. O
. O
something O
. O

Lots O
of O
people O
trying O
to O
outdo O
each O
other O
in O
grief O
, O
and O
I O
' O
m O
worried O
about O
what O
' O
s O
going O
to O
happen O
to O
his O
political O
and O
social O
legacy O
. O

I O
would O
love O
to O
think O
the O
coverage O
will O
be O
dignified O
, O
but O
I O
fear O
it O
won O
' O
t O
be O
. O

I O
was O
a O
bit O
confused O
, O
because O
just O
yesterday O
or O
the O
day O
before O
, O
there O
was O
a O
news O
report O
about O
how O
he O
was O
fighting O
from O
his O
deathbed O
. O

I O
hadn O
' O
t O
thought O
the O
end O
would O
be O
quite O
so O
close O
. O

But O
yes O
, O
he O
was O
undoubtedly O
one O
of O
the O
foremost O
people O
of O
the O
20th O
century O
, O
and O
I O
was O
reflecting O
the O
other O
day O
on O
" O
quiet O
" O
revolutionaries O
, O
who O
managed O
in O
their O
own O
way O
, O
to O
change O
the O
world O
in O
a O
tremendous O
way O
. O

Mandela B-PER
, O
Gandhi B-PER
, O
MLK B-PER
- O
they O
shook O
and O
changed O
societies O
. O

What O
a O
life O
. O

I O
' O
m O
not O
sad O
at O
his O
passing O
, O
but O
glad O
that O
he O
went O
, O
at O
a O
great O
age O
, O
in O
his O
own O
bed O
, O
surrounded O
by O
his O
family O
. O

That O
seemed O
an O
unlikely O
outcome O
for O
the O
longest O
time O
. O

There O
have O
been O
very O
few O
who O
have O
changed O
the O
world O
by O
sheer O
force O
of O
character O
, O
and O
even O
fewer O
who O
have O
done O
so O
for O
the O
better O
. O

He O
' O
ll O
be O
missed O
, O
and O
we O
could O
do O
with O
a O
few O
more O
like O
him O
. O

Nicely O
put O
Baron O
Greenback O
. O

He O
led O
his O
country O
peacefully O
from O
apartheid O
to O
democracy O
, O
an O
almost O
unbelievable O
feat O
. O

Rest O
in O

' O
s O
first O
reaction O
was O
whether O
they O
' O
ll O
cancel O
tonights O
live O
Sound O
of O

broadcast O
. O

I O
reassured O
her O
they O
wouldn O
' O
t O
dare O
. O

Not O
after O
such O
a O
large O
cast O
spent O
weeks O
rehearsing O
. O

But O
I O
bet O
the O
news O
division O
wants O
desperately O
to O
run O
their O
Mandela B-PER
coverage O
. O

GCHQ B-ORG

interesting O

Privacy B-ORG
International I-ORG
has O
a O
pretty O
interesting O
article O
on O
The B-ORG
Guardian I-ORG
' O
s O
Apple B-ORG
laptops O
. O

The B-ORG
Guardian I-ORG
was O
told O
by O
the O
British B-GPE
gov O
to O
destroy O
the O
Snowden B-PER
documents O
or O
turn O
them O
over O
. O

They O
decided O
to O
destroy O
the O
Snowden B-PER
documents O
rather O
than O
hand O
them O
over O
, O
since O
this O
would O
allow O
journalists O
to O
work O
overseas O
with O
them O
. O

However O
, O
GCHQ B-ORG
did O
not O
just O
destroy O
the O
hard O
drives O
, O
as O
you O
would O
expect O
. O

They O
also O
destroyed O
the O
keyboard O
controller O
chip O
, O
trackpad O
controller O
chip O
, O
and O
the O
inverter O
converter O
chip O
. O

I O
wonder O
what O
kind O
of O
surveillance O
implants O
those O
were O
. O

I O
' O
m O
guessing O
the O
keyboard O
controller O
was O
a O
keylogger O
the O
trackpad O
controller O
was O
something O
similar O
that O
captured O
mouse O
movements O
. O

The O
last O
one O
is O
strange O
though O
. O

Could O
be O
a O
screen O
capture O
device O
IMO O
. O

Full O
article O
: O

For O
intercepted O
devices O
, O
those O
controllers O
would O
be O
ideal O
places O
to O
hide O
key O
loggers O
. O

That O
should O
NOT O
be O
taken O
as O
" O
well O
these O
devices O
are O
manufactured O
with O
tracking O
imbedded O
" O
. O

Maybe O
, O
maybe O
not O
. O

I O
' O
d O
be O
curious O
as O
to O
what O
kind O
of O
physical O
security O
those O
reporters O
had O
over O
their O
laptops O
. O

If O
they O
left O
them O
around O
with O
no O
one O
watching O
them O
, O
they O
could O
have O
been O
intercepted O
and O
modified O
. O

If O
they O
were O
cautious O
and O
always O
had O
them O
with O
them O
, O
then O
I O
' O
d O
say O
it O
' O
s O
probably O
something O
built O
in O
from O
the O
factory O
, O
whether O
it O
' O
s O
deliberate O
or O
not O
. O

Not O
really O
. O

We O
are O
talking O
about O
* O
chips O
* O
here O
. O

Even O
with O
physical O
access O
and O
plenty O
of O
time O
and O
equipment O
you O
can O
' O
t O
" O
bug O
" O
a O
chip O
. O

Even O
replacing O
it O
requires O
a O
MAJOR O
effort O
and O
lots O
of O
equipment O
. O

We O
are O
talking O
about O
many O
soldering O
point O
per O
square O
mm O
( O
not O
inch O
) O
for O
todays O
chips O
on O
such O
tightly O
integrated O
boards O
as O
that O
of O
an O
" O
Air O
" O
. O

You O
need O
micro O
- O
meter O
precision O
to O
exchange O
chips O
, O
not O
to O
mention O
extremely O
precise O
heat O
control O
in O
a O
tiny O
space O
. O

And O
those O
chips O
are O
not O
supposed O
to O
have O
memory O
or O
anything O
where O
they O
could O
have O
stored O
software O
to O
intercept O
what O
goes O
through O
. O

Remember O
, O
the O
article O
pretty O
much O
says O
that O
it O
still O
looks O
like O
any O
normal O
Macbook O
Air O
, O
it O
' O
s O
not O
like O
they O
found O
hardware O
that O
hadn O
' O
t O
been O
there O
before O
. O

They O
destroyed O
chips O
that O
any O
such O
notebook O
has O
, O
and O
it O
is O
next O
to O
impossible O
that O
those O
are O
not O
the O
original O
chips O
. O

Agreed O
with O
LionessLover O
: O
it O
is O
inconceivable O
that O
the O
chips O
were O
not O
the O
originals O
. O

There O
is O
a O
reason O
the O
slightest O
component O
going O
off O
- O
song O
triggers O
an O
entire O
mobo O
replacement O
for O
any O
laptop O
. O

The O
only O
practical O
possibility O
is O
a O
logger O
with O
substantial O
flash O
storage O
in O
- O
chip O
, O
which O
is O
readily O
assessed O
by O
studying O
the O
chips O
' O
specs O
. O

Bottom O
line O
: O
not O
bloody O
likely O
. O

But O
useful O
theatrical O
agitprop O
. O

You O
assume O
they O
tell O
you O
the O
truth O
in O
those O
specs O
. O

That O
is O
an O
assumption O
that O
these O
days O
you O
will O
have O
to O
prove O
and O
not O
just O
make O
. O

So O
you O
are O
making O
a O
very O
bold O
statement O
based O
on O
nothing O
more O
than O
your O
assumption O
that O
they O
tell O
you O
everything O
. O

Sure O
, O
additional O
hardware O
options O
added O
for O
the O
NSA B-ORG
/ O
GCHQ B-ORG
will O
appear O
in O
the O
published O
specs O
- O
hahaha O
. O

A O
few O
years O
ago O
anyone O
who O
would O
have O
said O
what O
I O
just O
said O
would O
have O
been O
placed O
solidly O

but O
as O
I O
said O
, O
these O
days O
the O
burden O
of O
proof O
has O
somewhat O
reversed O
. O

So O
don O
' O
t O
make O
such O
ridiculous O
statements O
as O
if O
nothing O
had O
been O
revealed O
about O
the O
state O
of O

And O
don O
' O

you O
point O

: O

been O

Wow O
that O
is O
a O
big O
move O

Whoa O

Hmmmmm O

This O
gives O

an O

but O
, O
not O
sure O
how O
accretive O
it O
will O
be O
. O

Well O
, O
now O
we O
know O
the O
price O
, O
no O
surprise O
otherwise O
. O

Stunningly O
cheap O
, O
given O
the O
one O
- O
time O
market O
valuation O
of O
Nokia B-ORG
that O
topped O
$ O
100B O

Elop B-PER
is O
a O
Redmond B-GPE

alreay O
bet O
the O

, O
so O
he O
’ O
s O
coming O
back O
home O
. O

When O
Google B-ORG
paid O
$ O
12 O
. O
5B O
for O
Motorola B-ORG
Mobility I-ORG
, O
it O
gained O
a O
substantial O
portfolio O

IP O

Since O

’ O

bare O
( O

it O
wouldn O
’ O
t O
have O
had O
to O

) O
, O
the O
same O
is O
doubtful O
in O
this O
deal O
. O

Plus O
, O
Google B-ORG
has O
a O
habit O
of O
making O
acquisitions O
better O
and O
growing O
into O
new O
spaces O
whereas O
Microsoft B-ORG
does O
just O
the O
opposite O
. O

I O
suspect O
MSFT B-ORG
shareholders O
will O
be O
happy O
they O
only O
paid O
$ O
7B O
once O
the O
buyers O
remorse O
kicks O
in O
. O

The O
best O
part O
of O
the O
deal O
is O
Microsuck B-ORG
using O
their O
offshore O
cash O
to O
fund O
this O
. O

Take O
that O

Nokia B-ORG

This O
was O
the O
end O
game O
all O
along O
though O
since O
MS B-ORG
has O
been O
infusing O
cash O
into O
Nokia B-ORG
for O
awhile O
and O
Nokia B-ORG
is O
by O
far O
the O
biggest O
Win O

now O
. O

I O
think O
people O
forget O
Nokia B-ORG
is O
still O
the O
third O
largest O
phone O
maker O
, O
albeit O
the O
majority O
are O
dumb O

and O
older O
symbians O
, O
the O
Windows O

were O
there O
biggest O

There O

according O

Know O
why O
? O

One O
reason O
: O
the O
cash O
sitting O

that O

Why O

Yep O
, O
interesting O
. O

Nokia B-ORG

some O
pretty O
solid O

Will O
be O

to O

if O

Microsoft B-ORG
just O
got O
the O

Wednesday O

continued O
battles O

push O
insurgents O
out O
of O
long O
- O
held O
territory O
outside O
the O
northern O
city O
of O
Aleppo B-GPE
, O
in O
what O
appeared O
to O
be O
a O
major O
push O
to O
gain O
ground O
ahead O
of O
proposed O
internationally O
sponsored O
peace O
talks O
. O

State O

entering O
Hujeira B-LOC

the O
latest O
in O
a O
string O
of O
suburbs O
south O
of O
Damascus B-GPE
where O
the O
government O
has O
made O
inroads O
in O
recent O
days O
, O
trying O
to O
sever O
supply O
lines O
between O
rebel O

held O
towns O
that O
form O
an O
arc O
around O
the O
capital O

Despite O
rebel O
claims O
to O
be O
tightening O
a O
noose O
around O
the O
seat O
of O
power O
, O
and O
government O
claims O
that O
the O
army O
would O
soon O
push O
rebels O
out O
of O
the O
suburbs O
, O
the O
front O
lines O
around O
the O
capital O
have O
changed O
little O
over O
the O
past O
year O
, O
with O
rebel O
and O
government O
forces O
dug O
in O
within O
a O
few O
hundred O
yards O
of O
each O
other O
in O
many O
places O
. O

The O
standoff O
has O
been O
deadly O
for O
civilians O
. O

People O
have O
died O
of O
malnutrition O
in O
rebel O
enclaves O
blockaded O
by O
the O
government O
, O
which O
also O
suffer O
daily O
bombardments O

In O
Damascus B-GPE
, O
rebel O
mortar O
rounds O
continue O
to O
land O
at O
random O
; O
on O
Wednesday O
, O
funerals O
were O
held O
for O
four O
schoolchildren O
killed O
when O
a O
shell O
hit O
their O
school O
bus O
near O
the O
capital O
’ O

old O
city O

Rebels O
pushed O
back O
by O
detonating O
an O
explosion O
in O
the O
southern O
Damascus B-GPE
neighborhood O
at O
Tadamon B-LOC
, O
long O
divided O
between O
government O
and O
rebel O
control O

The O
explosion O
targeted O
a O
checkpoint O
that O
opposition O
activists O
said O
was O
staffed O
by O
Shiite O
militias O
aiding O
the O
government O
forces O
in O
the O
fight O
. O

Around O
Aleppo B-GPE
, O
rebel O
groups O
have O
issued O
an O
emergency O
call O
for O
full O
mobilization O
of O
all O
insurgents O
after O
the O
government O
re O

established O
control O
in O
recent O
days O
over O
key O

The O

has O
been O
divided O

months O

The O

Many O
Syrians O
on O
both O
sides O
of O
the O
conflict O
see O
the O
Kurdish O
move O
as O
the O
latest O
sign O
of O
the O
de O

partitioning O
of O
a O
country O
increasingly O
ruled O

a O
patchwork O

areas O
of O
neighboring O
Turkey B-GPE

Iraq B-GPE

All O

For O

fighting O
in O
the O
area O
has O
been O
less O
a O
